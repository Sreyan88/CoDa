You *can't* get pregnant if you aren't ovulating (no egg, no pregnancy), and if you *are* ovulating, you will have a period.  However, it is possible that even though you *haven't* been ovulating, you could start at any time.  Therefore you have to assume you are potentially fertile.\n\nIf you want to know how to recognize when you are about to ovulate, please read _Taking Charge of Your Fertility_ by Toni Weschler.  It has lots of information that will help you figure out what is going on.	Health

It sounds like she might be as uncertain about where you stand as you are.  And with good reason...you haven't given her any indication that you want a 1 on 1 relationship with her.  \n\nThe next time she flirts with you, lean in for a kiss.  If she puckers up, finish the kiss and you'll have your answer in the affirmative.  If she ignores you and starts talking about what a wonderful friend you are...you've got your answer in the negative.  Girls are uncertain about this kind of thing too, so that is why it is such a relief to be around a guy who will take action and fight for them.  A little stolen kiss that catches you unexpectedly can be romantic and reassuring at the same time!  Good luck!	Family & Relationships

"I have some experience with designing lightweight missiles (Nerf type guns specifically) and I can tell you that there are 3 main items of importance when it comes to getting the maximum range possible:\n\n(1) Have a set of 3 or 4 fins that poke out to just about the same diameter as the body of the rocket if the rocket tapers in at the back, or about 25% to 50% greater diameter than the body of the rocket if it does not taper.\n\n(2) make sure you have no ""shelves"" in the design.  ""Shelves"" are rear-facing step-like features that create suction as the rocket is flying through the air.  Imagine a bullet flying through the air, the bullet is basically cylinder-shaped but it is pointed at the forward end.  The rear end is flat.  This flat creates a shelf, and a region of suction forms there which slows the bullet down.  When you are dealing with something low-density like a soda bottle rocket, this suction has a much more noticeable effect than it does for higher-density projectiles like bullets.  But even with bullets, they use a shape called a ""boat tail"" to overcome this -- see the ""Rifle Bullets"" section of this website for a picture of what I mean:\nhttp://matrix.dumpshock.com/raygun/basics/bullets.html\n\n\nFor a what-not-to-do, take a look at these missiles:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/images/B0002FYR0M/ref=dp_otherviews_2/002-1250901-3240058?ie=UTF8&s=sporting-goods&img=2\nNotice how the back end is flat?  That is where all the suction happens.  If they had a way to make those missiles taper together at the tail, they would go a lot farther.  Since a soda bottle tapers at the mouth (which is the rear when launched as a rocket), you want to maximixe this effect.\n\nhttp://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/e7/fc/a232d250fca071ddd6b17010.L.jpg\nNotice how this one not only is flat at the rear, but it also has a ""shelf"" feature that goes all the way around it, at the back side of the yellow warhead section.  That will create a lot of suction too.  If that were tapered into the body like the rightmost missile in this picture, it would go a lot further:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Titan_Missile_Family.png\n\n(3) Nosecone -- ideally for a low-velocity low-density missile like a soda bottle rocket, this should be rounded.  Like the ones at the top of this webpage about soda bottle rockets:\nhttp://waterrocket.uh-lab.de/backglide.htm\n\nYou can probably get some really good nosecones for relatively little money at a local hobby shop, in the model rocketry department.  Failing that, look for a thin hard-plastic ball that you can cut in half.  Some soda bottles already have rounded ends, but these are becoming very rare now since they were more expensive to make than the ones with flat ends.  If you can't find any good round nosecones, you can make a cone-shaped one by cutting a big circle out of construction paper and then cutting a ""pie slice"" out of that circle.  Now you can easily roll up the remaining circle section into a pointed cone.  Play around with it until you have reduced it to the least amount of paper needed to achieve the desired cone, because any extra paper is just weight that must be moved and yet won't help it fly any better.\n\nHere are some great web pages for this fun sport -- including one from NASA!"

"From what I have seen of the modern ""tongues speaking"" crowd (of which I got saved in), tis very much likely more demon than of God.  The devil and demons can walk through the church building if not bound before services through prayer, and can take possession of the people within...  God is not the creator of chaos, and the very thing that the wiggling on the floor foaming at the mouth speaking jibberish is jsut that..chaos.  It usually happens when the music is revved up, full of emotion, can't think cuz it's so loud...and then the flopping begins..  I saw this when I started out in the Pentecostal church.  You do not see this in a good solid bible believing/preaching independent fundamental baptist church.  Our men pray together before services to bind satan from our building and services and never never never has anyone flopped on the floor jabbering in some unknown language.  Our music isn't revved up..we focus on the Word rather than the emotional music...there's nothing wrong with a soul stirring hymn, but it sholdn't be the focus of our worship...  If for some reason someone felt the need to speak in tongues, biblically, there must be an interpreter.

I've been enlisted, trying to go back in as an officer.  If you go officer, you submit a wish list with 10 mos's (jobs) on it. The way it works for ocs is the top of their class gets their first picks... rolls down from there. ROTC is similar. MI/Aviation are the two hardest to get into. If you are siting behind a desk all the time as an officer chances are so are the enlisted under you. Yes, officers are more like managers, but depending on the mos they are right in the thick of things with you. More money as an officer. Better enlistement bonuses for enlisted. No idea about the language..   My opininon, go to rotc, get your degree, go in as an officer. if it's not your cup of tea, you have the degree to fall back on. - good luck     /salute	Politics & Government
"The ad says something about a ""bad mouth""  and depicts Snoop Dog being sent to a hell inhabited by old ladies with horns.  Goats have an association with the devil which I would guess might come from some sort of goat association with pagan tradition, and the association of goat and evil or goat and devil being applied by Christians during the Medieval period.  This goat is brought up along with Snoop Dog to a heaven like place after, presumably, chewing the Orbit gum.  This advertisement implies that the gum will make you clean and wash away your sins (which begs the question- what KIND of dirty taste DO you have in your mouth, anyways?).  But, any how, the goat is brought up to heaven after chewing the gum and is transformed into a more pleasant and ethereal creature: a goat unicorn (goaticorn?).  So, in short: (goat=sin=dirty) + Orbit gum = (clean=divine)."	Entertainment & Music

There are a variety of treatment options available for patients with hyperhidrosis, including:\nAntiperspirants. Excessive sweating may be controlled with strong anti-perspirants, which plug the sweat ducts. Products containing 10% to 15% aluminum chloride hexahydrate are the first line of treatment for underarm sweating. Some patients may be be prescribed a product containing a higher dose of aluminum chloride, which is applied nightly onto the affected areas. Antiperspirants can cause skin irritation, and strong doses of aluminum chloride can damage clothing. Note: Deodorants do not prevent sweating, but are helpful in reducing body odor. \nMedication. Anticholinergics drugs, such as glycopyrrolate (Robinul, Robinul-Forte), help to prevent the stimulation of sweat glands. Although effective for some patients, these drugs have not been studied as well as other treatments. Side effects include dry mouth, dizziness, and problems with urination. \nIontophoresis. This FDA-approved procedure uses electricity to temporarily turn off the sweat gland. It is most effective for sweating of the hands and feet. The hands or feet are placed into water, and then a gentle current of electricity is passed through it. The electricity is gradually increased until the patient feels a light tingling sensation. The therapy lasts about 10-20 minutes and requires several sessions. Side effects include skin cracking and blisters, although rare. \nBotox. Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) was approved by the FDA in 2004 for the treatment of severe underarm sweating, a condition called primary axillary hyperhidrosis. Small doses of purified botulinum toxin injected into the underarm temporarily block the nerves that stimulate sweating. Side effects include injection-site pain and flu-like symptoms. If you are considering Botox for other areas of excessive sweating talk to your doctor in detail. Botox used for sweating of the palms can cause mild, but temporary weakness and intense pain. \nEndoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS). In severe cases, a minimally-invasive surgical procedure called sympathectomy may be recommended. This surgery turns off the signal which tells the body to sweat excessively. ETS surgery is done while the patient is asleep under general anesthesia. The doctor makes two or three tiny cuts under the arm. The patient's lung is collapsed so the surgeon has more room to work. A tiny camera, called an endoscope, is inserted to guide the surgeon to the appropriate nerve. After the nerve associated with the overactive gland is identified, it is removed or destroyed. The lung is restored to normal, and the wound closed with stitches. The identical procedure is done on the other side of the body. The surgery takes about a half hour. Patients usually go home the next day, but may experience pain for about a week. ETS requires special training. Before having this surgery, make sure your doctor is properly trained. The procedure is usually performed on patients with excessively sweaty palms. It is not as effective on those with excessive armpit sweating. Risks include artery damage, nerve damage, and increased sweating. New sweating occurs in about 50% of patients.	Health

"In 1507, cartographer Martin Waldseemueller named the New World ""America"" after the Italian Amerigo Vespucci.  Amerigo navigated a couple of trips to the New World beginning 1499, but never actually founded a voyage himself.  It remains a large mystery why Waldseemueller chose Amerigo's first name as the choice for the name of the New World.  It may be that he wrote about the New World and was more widely-known for his writings, which led to the naming.  It may be that Amerigo could be easily translated into Latin, and began with ""A"" like many other foreign continents.  Regardless, he lives in fame to this day."	Education & Reference

I dont know a whole lot about dirt bikes, but there was an article on consumerreports.com that said the following. Hope it helps!\n\nBikes\nWhether you plan to hit the road or the trail, you'll get more bike for your buck than ever before.\n\nIf you're planning to buy a bike, chances are your new ride will have an aluminum frame, even if the bike costs less than $500. It might even have disc brakes or 27 gears. These features, once found only on more expensive bikes, bring the benefits of lighter weight, better braking in sloppy conditions, and more efficient pedaling to cyclists with a modest budget.\n\nHigher-priced bikes are getting better, too. The best of the $1,000-and-up models in our most recent tests had the shock absorption and handling previously found only on bikes costing two or three times as much.\n\nWhichever bike you choose, there's good reason to buy it from one of the nation's 5,300 bike shops, rather than from a department store or toy store. And you don't have to spend a fortune. We found fine choices for pavement rides that cost less than $300 and very good bikes for off-road cycling for $440. The bikes for serious trail riding cost $1,000 or more.\n\n\nWHAT'S AVAILABLE\n\nBrands include Bianchi, Cannondale, Diamondback, Fuji, Gary Fisher, Giant, GT, Iron Horse, Jamis, Klein, Landrider, LeMond, Mongoose, Raleigh, Schwinn, Specialized, and Trek.\n\nFull-suspension mountain bikes. These bikes are best for rough terrain with steep slopes. You'll get a shock-absorbing suspension fork and rear-suspension frame, which provide the best control and comfort on the roughest terrain. Most have 27 speeds and 26-inch wheels. All have wide, knobby tires; narrow or moderate-width saddle; and flat or riser handlebars.\n\nPrince range: $1,000 to more than $4,000.\n\nFront-suspension mountain bikes. These bikes are best for less-rugged off-road trails. You'll get a shock-absorbing suspension fork and rigid frame, fine for tamer trails. These bikes need less maintenance and are more efficient on smooth terrain than full suspension mountain bikes. Most have 24 or 27 speeds; 26-inch wheels; wide, knobby tires; narrow or moderately wide saddle; and flat or riser handlebars.\n\nPrice range: $400 to more than $2,000.\n\nHybrid bikes. These bikes are best for moderate-speed riding on pavement and smooth dirt paths. A cross between comfort and road bikes, most hybrids have a shock-absorbing suspension fork and seatpost; 24 speeds; 700C wheels (a designation from the French system, indicating size and width; it's about 27-inch); midwidth, fairly smooth tires; moderately wide saddle; and riser handlebars.\n\nPrice range: $400 to more than $500.\n\nComfort bikes. These bikes are best for casual cycling on pavement and smooth dirt paths. Most comfort bikes have a shock-absorbing suspension fork and seatpost; 21 speeds; 26-inch wheels; wide, relatively smooth tires; wide saddle; and riser handlebars. Generally have most upright riding position, which casual riders often find most comfortable.\n\nPrice range: $250 to more than $400.\n\nRoad bikes. These bikes are best for fast and/or long distance rides on pavement. Most have a lightweight frame with no suspension; 18 to 30 speeds; 700C wheels (about 27-inch); narrow, smooth tires; narrow saddle; and drop handlebars. The bent-over riding position reduces wind resistance at higher speeds, while the narrower seat facilitates pedaling.\n\nPrice range: $500 to more than $3,000.\n\n\nIMPORTANT FEATURES\n\nBrakes. Long-arm cantilever brakes (V-brakes or linear-pull brakes) are fine for most uses. For rough, sloppy terrain, go with disc brakes, which will spare your wheel rims from the abrasion of muddy braking. Some bikes are sold with your choice of brakes. Discs add $100 or more. You can retrofit some bikes with discs; ask at the bike shop.\n\nHandlebars. High-rise handlebars let you sit fairly upright. With low-rise and flat handlebars, you lean forward.	Sports

If you are more than 100 pounds overweight you should qualify for gastric by-pass surgery. My mother had this surgery and has lost more than 150 pounds so far. Although she has had no complications, there are some people who have. So, it is not without risk, but it is something to think about. I know how frustrating it can be to feel like you have so much weight to lose and to feel like doing it 1-2 pounds at a time is completely overwhelming. \n\nI wish you luck in whatever you decide!
