"They do dream in images, but the images they describe are not the same as yours or mine.  When asked to describe what they dreamed about, visually impaired individuals in some studies described familiar objects in contexts that were completely skewed -- like a huge dog shape for a cloud, or sometimes described something unimaginable to you or I, but it is how they always imagined it to be.\n\nInterestingly, people who had sight but lost it, also come to lose their visual memories of typical objects when they begin to use their other senses to compensate.  Their dreams become altered, as well.\n\nIt's a very interesting topic, and lots of material to read if you are really interested.  ""Planet of the Blind""  =  Very interesting book."	Health

Alesis Adat recorders have been the best ones in my experience. You dont loose the tracks if the unit malfunctions because they are backed up on removable hard drives. Even people that I have worked with who have powermac G5's in their studios have these interfaced to them because of reliability and their extreme usefulness for tracking live shows to be mixed/edited in a studio.\n\n“Adats are a bizillionjillionkathousand (plus infinity) times better then anything else. Including: long walks on the beach, puppies, kittens, good wine, making out with a good looking woman, and kicking your arch nemesis in the face.\n\nThey have more gravitational pull/heat outsource, pretty colors, and poems written about them then the sun does. They can cure cancer, give everyone a job, and elect an efficient congress. Like electricity, they posses powers of magic that are beyond our control and understanding. \n\nYears from now we'll have reality TV shows and documentaries about Adats, the people that use them, and how much they are better then everything else in this world (see first paragraph). Japan already has several animated series about specially trained people that are licensed by the government to use Adats for the powers of good.\n\nOne day... Many thousands of billions of years in the future, long after our civilizations have turned to dust, and the dust has turned into smaller dust, and then that dust has turned into microscopic dust, Aliens will find our Adats and know that we were totally awesome- they'll will create their own Adats and the cycle of outstanding multitrack recorders that are a Kazillion times better then any thing else we have ever known (see first paragraph) will continue.”	Entertainment & Music

Philadelphia dealt with discrimination in employment on the basis of sexual orientation (being, in this case, a Gay man) as well as the basis of HIV status.  The character played by Tom Hanks was fired from his job as an attorney for being Gay and having AIDS.  The right of HIV-positive persons to protection in employment and reasonable accomodation is protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act.  The film explores the homophobia of Hanks' co-workers, as well as the struggle with homophobia of Hanks' attorney, a heterosexual civil rights/employment rights lawyer played by Denzel Washington.  Washington's character learns to make the connection between prejudice and discrimination against Gay men and his own experience as a member of a discriminated against racial minority.

Breathing, the process whereby an organism (living thing) obtains oxygen from its surroundings, to take part in internal chemical reactions which break down food to release energy. Breathing also usually gives out waste carbon dioxide as an unwanted by-product of these reactions. Breathing is one aspect of respiration, which is a term that includes both physically obtaining oxygen, and also using it in chemical pathways inside cells to release energy—the process of cellular respiration\n\nMany aquatic animals obtain oxygen dissolved in the water by muscle-powered movements, such as when the forward motion of a fish or the pumping actions of its mouth and throat force a flow of water over its gills ( See also Fish). This is underwater breathing. Tiny organisms “breathe” by the process of passive seepage or diffusion of oxygen through their body surfaces. Plants also obtain oxygen by diffusion from the air or water around them, usually into the leaves.	Science & Mathematics

Quite honestly, lack of success against upper-echelon international teams. The U.S. may be ranked #5 in the world according to FIFA, but that does not mean they are the fifth-best team. They need to prove, from a psychological standpoint, that they have the talent and the desire to compete against teams like Brazil, England, Argentina and Holland in top-level international football.\n\nThe lack of experience by American players in top-level international football hurts them the most. The U.S. is beginning to send more and more players into the Bundesliga, the Premiereship, Serie A, and other top-flight leagues, but there are still too many career MLSers on the squad.	Sports

You need to use Boyle's Law to calculate this.  Pressure is directly related to volume.  PV(inside) = PV(outside)  If the pressure of your tank is 2500PSI and holds 50L and atmospheric pressure is 14.7PSI we can calculate the volume once all the gas is released.  Since we can not get the last 14.7PSI out of the tank due to atmospheric pressure we have to subtract that from our tank pressure.  So we have...\n(2485.3PSI)(50L) = (14.7PSI)(X)  solving for X we would have a total volume of 169.07L.  Divide this by the flow rate and you can determine how long it should last.

It is called Order of Order of Presidential Succession\n\nBelow is the explaination and the list if God Forbid something happens tomorrow....\n\nOrder of Presidential Succession\nAccording to the Presidential Succession Act of 1792, the Senate president pro tempore1 was next in line after the vice president to succeed to the presidency, followed by the Speaker of the House. \n\nIn 1886, however, Congress changed the order of presidential succession, replacing the president pro tempore and the Speaker with the cabinet officers. Proponents of this change argued that the congressional leaders lacked executive experience, and none had served as president, while six former secretaries of state had later been elected to that office. \n\nThe Presidential Succession Act of 1947, signed by President Harry Truman, changed the order again to what it is today. The cabinet members are ordered in the line of succession according to the date their offices were established. \n\nPrior to the ratification of the 25th Amendment in 1967, there was no provision for filling a vacancy in the vice presidency. When a president died in office, the vice president succeeded him, and the vice presidency then remained vacant. The first vice president to take office under the new procedure was Gerald Ford, who was nominated by Nixon on Oct. 12, 1973, and confirmed by Congress the following Dec. 6.\n\nThe Vice President Richard Cheney\nSpeaker of the House John Dennis Hastert\nPresident pro tempore of the Senate1 Ted Stevens\nSecretary of State Condoleezza Rice\nSecretary of the Treasury John Snow\nSecretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld\nAttorney General Alberto Gonzales\nSecretary of the Interior (Vacant)\nSecretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns\nSecretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez2\nSecretary of Labor Elaine Chao3\nSecretary of Health and Human Services Mike Leavitt\nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development Alphonso Jackson\nSecretary of Transportation Norman Yoshio Mineta\nSecretary of Energy Samuel Bodman\nSecretary of Education Margaret Spellings\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs Jim Nicholson\nSecretary of Homeland Security4 Michael Chertoff\nNOTE: An official cannot succeed to the Presidency unless that person meets the Constitutional requirements.\n1. The president pro tempore presides over the Senate when the vice president is absent. By tradition the position is held by the senior member of the majority party.\n2. Carlos Gutierrez was born in Cuba and is ineligible.\n3. Elaine Chao was born in Taiwan and is ineligible.\n4. In late July 2005, the Senate passed a bill moving the Homeland Security secretary to number 8 on the list. The bill is awaiting House approval.\n\nI hope this helps!!!	Politics & Government
If you have credit card debt that's probably th first place to start compared to homeowner or student loan debt.\n\nThe generally accepted best approach to paying dowbn debt goes a little something like this:\n1.) stop taking on new debt aka stop your discretionary spending\n2.) pay the minimum payment on all your bills except for the one with the highest interest rate. The bill with the highest interest rate should be paid down as aggressively as possible aka pay as much as you can to that bill after paying the minimums on all the other bills.\n3.) If you're getting offers for new credit cards with lower interest AND free balance transfers, then sign up for that card and transfer all your debts to that card from other credit cards and then it's easier and cheaper to concentrate on paying down that card.\n4.) Call your credit card companies and request lower interest rates, if you don't ask they won't offer it, so call!	Business & Finance

"Catwoman (real name Selina Kyle) is a DC Comics character created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane. She first appeared in Batman #1 (Spring, 1940), where she was initially known as ""The Cat"". Her name ""Selina"" derives from the ancient lunar deity Selene.\n\nAlthough originally introduced as an opponent for Batman, Catwoman's status as hero or villain is ambiguous; she has her own moral code (she abhors killing, though has resorted to it at times) and has occasionally teamed up with Batman and other heroes against greater threats, even saving the lives of the entire Justice League on one occasion. She represents a gray area in Batman's otherwise black and white life where the line between good and evil blurs, and his attraction to her stems from this perception that, in her way, she's kind of a female version of himself: another dark, beautiful creature that prowls the night.\n\nCatwoman, in her first appearance, wore no costume or disguise at all, and it was not until her next appearance that she donned a mask, which was a theatrically face-covering cat-mask that had the appearance of a real cat, rather than a more stylized face mask seen in her later incarnations. Later, she wore a dress with a hood that came with ears, and still later, a bodysuit with attached boots and either a domino or glasses-mask. In the 1960s, Catwoman's bodysuit was green in color, which was typical of villains of that era. In the 1990s, she usually wore a skintight purple bodysuit, before switching to a black leather outfit that recalls Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman costume in Batman Returns.

Earth Radiation Balance and Impact of Clouds\n\n The Earth's climate system constantly adjusts so as to maintain a balance between the solar energy reaching Earth, and the energy escaping from Earth. For the Earth's system, the important components of the radiation budget are the planet surface, the atmosphere and clouds.\n\n Clouds can warm up the Earth and the atmosphere by absorbing terrestrial radiation (or longwave radiation) which escapes to space and emitting a portion of this absorbed energy both towards the surface and to space. Clouds can also have a negative effect on the Earth's climate, causing a cooling of the Earth. This results from the scattering back to space of shortwave rays from the Sun. This leads to a decrease of absorbed solar radiation by the surface of the Earth, since the cloud shield the Earth from incoming solar radiation, leading to a cooling of the Earth. \n\n Whether clouds cool or warm the Earth's climate depends on their temperature (or height in the atmosphere), thickness and particle constitution. For example, high and thin cirrus clouds tend to cause a net heating of the Earth since they are relatively transparent to incoming solar radiation, but highly absorbing to outgoing terrestrial radiation. This is due to their composition, of large ice particles, which scatter sunlight in the forward direction (i.e.: towards the surface of the Earth) and which are highly absorbing in the infrared (i.e.: to terrestrial radiation).\n\n Clouds are therefore one of the most important factor regulating the current climate system and future climate change. Measurements of cloud radiative forcing are needed to increase our understanding of the Earth's climate (Tian and Ramanathan, 2001). Monthly average results suggest that equatorial convective clouds have a neutral effect on the Earth radiation balance because the visible energy that they reflect to space is balanced by the infrared energy retained in the troposphere by absorption (Ramanathan et al, 1989, Cess et al, 2001, Ramanathan et al, 1989).

For every action there is an opposite and equal reaction.  The superhero has imparted momentum to the piano and yet we do not see the ""opposite and equal reaction"".   Perhaps you have seen the true, real life, effect in other movies you may have seen.  Movies in which cannon are being fired.  When the cannon fires it does what?  It recoils.  Armies and Navies for that matter take great pains to control the flight of the cannon upon recoil.  Our superhero seems to be immune to recoil, immune to the conservation of momentum and thereby immune to the laws of physics.  I call ""Foul""!\n\n2.  If the truck is at rest when struck by the car, then the car loses KE while the truck gains KE.  If the truck is in motion when struck by the car, in an inelastic collision, meaning the car an truck become entangled and inseparable, then the truck most certainly loses the most KE.  KE= 1/2 * m* v^2.  Velocity (v) is the key here, velocity and it's relationship to momentum (p=m * v; p - momentum). \n\nIn an inelastic collision, conservation of energy is maintained but conservation of KE is not.  (Some of the kenetic energy will be converted to the energy of deformation, sound of the collision)  The Truck will retain most of it's velocity whlie the lower mass car will accelerate largely in what ever direction the truck was headed, most likely causing a net loss of absolute velocity and therefore a loss of kenetic energy for the car.  But the mass of the truck is much larger than the mass of the car.  So the answer to the original question actualy depends on the speed of the truck compared to the speed of the car before the collision.  Why?  Because the collision is inelastic.\n\n""Perfectly elastic collisions are those in which no kinetic energy is lost in the collision. Macroscopic collisions are generally inelastic and do not conserve kinetic energy, though of course the total energy is conserved. The extreme inelastic collision is one in which the colliding objects stick together after the collision, and this case may be analyzed in general terms""\n\n3.  Force and Pressure.   Pressure is simply force exerted over a specified area.  In a car crash, pressure is what kills us and in the case of the airbag, Counter-Force over a wider area is what saves us.  Pounds per square inch, Phyiscs calls that Pressure.  Pressue = Force / Area while Force = M * a^2.  We know that an object in motion tends to stay in motion.  And we know that the law of conservation of momentum guarentees the universe that what is in motion tends to stay in motion and what is at rest tends to stay at rest.  That being said, Force exerted over a given area is called Pressure.  During a collision, a human body has, prior to the collision, a velocity, a mass and therefore a momentum.  And that momentum drives that human being to ""stay in motion"" even after a collision occurs.  In order to decelerate the body, a force must be imparted.  Enter the airbag.  The airbag inflates.  As the body presses against the airbag, the airbag compresses.  As the air bag compresses and it's overall volume is reduced, the area over which the air pressure acts is less therefore the force / area is more causing a ""push back"" or Counter-Force affect on the body pressing into it.   Opposite and Equal.  As long as the airbag is strong enough to withstand the surge of pressure (force/area (pounds per sqaure inch)) then the human body will be protected by the absorption of energy that is required to deform the plastic membrane that is the ""airbag"".  The human frame will be allowed to more slowly decelerate from the collision.  That deceleration will be slow enough to allow the cells and musculature of the human body to maintain its functionality."	Science & Mathematics

However, if it happened and you put yourself in a situation where you was emabarrassed or lost self esteem, you have to recover as fast as possible not to look like a crybaby in other people's eyes.\nSocially, self esteem is something that you create. I mean that in normal cases people will treat you within the space yoiu offer them. Well, did you see the movie ""the family stone""? That lady put herself in those dramatic situations and of course she must have lost her self confidence. I mean that all of us, all normal people, know what is right and what is wrong. Just do the right thing and believe me you will always retain yourself esteem.\nFinally, there is something that you have to remember: every person has got something that he is perfect at, and that no else can do it as perfect as he does it. Try to discover what you are really perfect at and do your best to invest in it. And remember, nobody is perfcet. All people make mistakes, even those who make advices - including me now - have got large proplems that they need advice about too. What I want to say is that every one is the best doctor for himself. Everyone knows himself more than anybody else does. You are your best doctor and best advisor. \n\nI hope I could help"	Business & Finance

"HMO stands for ""heatlh maintenance organization"".  \nPPO stands for ""preferred provider organization"".\nWith an HMO, you chose your PCP (personal care physician) from a network of physicians who have joined the HMO.  For referrals, the PCP has to submit an authorization request to the HMO which approves (or denies) all referrals to specialists, all tests done outside the PCP's office and all elective hospitalizations and surgeries.  Referrals are only to other physicians and hospitals who have signed up as providers for the HMO.\nA PPO does not require a referral.  You can go to any physician, any specialist, any hospital whenever you want.  Physicians who have signed agreements with the PPO plan will be paid according to the agreement rate.  The patient will get a reduced patient share if they choose a physician who has a signed agreement with the plan.  But if the patient chooses a physician or hospital not on the plan, the insurance will still pay but the patient share .\n(copayment) and/or deductible will be higher.\nPremiums are much lower for an HMO than for a PPO because the HMO has complete control over the patient's care.\nAs far as precription coverage goes, HMOs have a list of approved drugs.  Many also have an annual maximum for drug benefits which is often quite low (usually $600 to $1000 a year).  PPOs may charge higher copays, but their annual drug maximum is significantly higher, sometimes no maximum at all.\nBottom line, if you're rarely sick choose the HMO.\nIf you need good coverage and can afford the deductibles and the copays, PPO will get you better care."

"If the union fails to represent you the best you can do is hire a lawyer for a possible suit against the union.  I'd be concerned though if they don't feel they can support you.  Unions will generally support any member unless there's clear evidence not to.  There's not much ""regulation"" truly on the part of the union in regards to it's members.  Most issues are contractual and not ""legal"" issues.  The best the could do is if there were serious problems decertify the union making you non-union workers.  It's sort of lopsided since the business has tons of laws regarding unions, but unions have few laws/restrictions on them. (I'm NOT saying they're bad, just that I feel it's a bit lop-sided)\n\nAlso remember just because you don't like they're decsion they're still representing you, it's more a matter of opinion.  \n\nFinally remember that a union is a BUSINESS and it's main goal is to make money by providing a service (dealing with workers issues).  Also remember that the union is looking out for the union, NOT indivdual persons.  While they'll fight for an employee, if it's better for the union as a whole not to fight they'll generally do that."	Politics & Government

I have tried twice before and got 46 days the first time and 30 days the second time and used the nicotine gum to do it BUT the most important thing I did and forgot to keep doing therefore I started up again and that was to change people,places and things.\nIn the beginning I stayed away from people who smoked and stayed away from places where I was use to smoking  ie my favorite eating place.Drank water with my meals as I use to drink coffee with my meals and would smoke while drinking coffee before my meal came and after I had finished my meal.\nI avoided my usual smoking break time outside with other employees.\nI tend to be a realy high wired person so as I started out with my efforts to quit smoking I made up my mind to run in low gear and to quit putting pressure on myself and to quit letting others laziness and imperfections bother me and to take it all in stride.\nThe only thing I can figure I did wrong was I got too comfortable with my efforts of not smoking and in doing so I forgot to keep up the work of avoiding familar people,places and things that encouraged my desire to smoke.\nI didn't want to gain the weight that most people say you will do when you quit smoking since we tend to exchange one habit for another so I made sure that I had plenty of fresh fruits and veggies on hand.\nI also made sure that I had plenty of my favorite gum on hand to help me get through those tough moments when the nicotine gum did not seem appealing or when it was too soon to have another piece.\nMy family,friends,employer and fellow employees were very supportive in my efforts.\nMy clothes,my house ,my car started to smell so much and my mouth was losing that bottom of the ashtray taste during my efforts to quit and I intend to quit again. .  . and this time FOREVER!\nPeople will certainly climb your backside for smoking and will rag on you forever but when you quit smoking they rarely give you as much credit or praise. . most of them do not really realize just how hard it is to give up smoking. . they say it is as hard as getting off of heroine so be sure to not let this discourage you. \nOne of the most important things to remember is that you want to quit smoking more than you want to smoke.\n\nThey say that the first 72hours of not smoking is when the nicotine leaves your body so the next time I quit smoking it is going to be cold turkey as I can't afford the gum or the patches for months on end and thusly dragging out the quitting smoking process and I will reminding myself that I want to quit smoking more than I want to smoke.\nI also want to set a good example for my grandchildren who are under the age of 4.(It is extremely hard to explain to my grandchildren why their Grammie smokes.)\n\nGood Luck \n\n\n\nP.S.

After the 3rd out is made, the ball that made the last out is oftentimes returned to the pitchers mound to use the next inning.\n\nHope that helps!	Sports

"(m)\n\nThe difference between weather and climate is a measure of time. Weather is what conditions of the atmosphere are over a short period of time, and climate is how the atmosphere ""behaves"" over relatively long periods of time. \n\nWhen we talk about climate change, we talk about changes in long-term averages of daily weather. Today, children always hear stories from their parents and grandparents about how snow was always piled up to their waists as they trudged off to school. Children today in most areas of the country haven't experienced those kinds of dreadful snow-packed winters, except for the Northeastern U.S. in January 2005. The change in recent winter snows indicate that the climate has changed since their parents were young. \n\nIf summers seem hotter lately, then the recent climate may have changed. In various parts of the world, some people have even noticed that springtime comes earlier now than it did 30 years ago. An earlier springtime is indicative of a possible change in the climate. \n\naddition to long-term climate change, there are shorter term climate variations. This so-called climate variability can be represented by periodic or intermittent changes related to El Niño, La Niña, volcanic eruptions, or other changes in the Earth system"	Education & Reference

"A ribozyme (from ribonucleic acid enzyme, also called RNA enzyme or catalytic RNA) is an RNA molecule that catalyzes a chemical reaction. Many natural ribozymes catalyze either their own cleavage or the cleavage of other RNAs, but they have also been found to catalyze the aminotransferase activity of the ribosome. Investigators studying the origin of life have produced ribozymes in the laboratory that are capable of catalyzing their own synthesis under very specific conditions.\n\nBefore the discovery of ribozymes, proteins were the only known biological catalysts. In 1967, Carl Woese, Francis Crick, and Leslie Orgel were the first to suggest that RNA could act as a catalyst based upon findings that it can form complex secondary structures[1]. The first ribozyme was discovered in the 1980s by Thomas R. Cech, who was studying RNA splicing in the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila. This ribozyme was found in the intron of an RNA transcript and removed itself from the transcript. Ribozymes often have divalent metal ions such as Mg2+ as cofactors. In 1989, Thomas R. Cech and Sidney Altman won the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their ""discovery of catalytic properties of RNA.""[2]\n\nAlthough most ribozymes are quite rare in the cell, their roles are sometimes essential to life. For example, the functional part of the ribosome, the molecular machine that translates RNA into proteins, is fundamentally a ribozyme.\n\nRNA can also act as a hereditary molecule, which encouraged Walter Gilbert to propose that in the past, the cell used RNA as both the genetic material and the structural and catalytic molecule, rather than dividing these functions between DNA and protein as they are today. This hypothesis became known as the ""RNA world hypothesis"" of the origin of life.\n\nIf ribozymes were the first molecular machines used by early life, then today's remaining ribozymes -- such as the ribosome machinery -- could be considered living fossils of a life based primarily on nucleic acids.\n\nA recent test-tube study of prion folding suggests that an RNA may catalyze the pathological protein conformation in the manner of a chaperone enzyme[3].\n\nSome known ribozymes include RNase P, Group I and Group II introns, leadzyme, hairpin ribozyme, hammerhead ribozyme, hepatitis delta virus ribozyme, and tetrahymena ribozyme."

Semi-technically speaking the penis fills with blood and becomes larger and harder by that blood being held in the penis. A penis will go flaccid and shrink once the blood is released.\n\nSo, it isn't quite nerves that cause the erection although the human body is full of sensitive nerve endings under th eskin that when massaged or caressed can offer wonderful feelings that might result in the penis becoming erect. And it doesn't have to be the nerves in the genital region receiving the attention either. Often by doign a back massage on a guy or even legs, he will display a nice hard penis.\n\nAlthough if you are always pestering or nagging a guy, you will be said to get on his nerves but that will not have the desired effect of making his penis erect. If anything it will shrink it even further - hehe.	Health

"I would say that Cherynobl was not a star, nor did it come from the heavens. Even the fact that Cherynobl was a nuclear plant doesn't help. It worked through nuclear fission, a much different way than a star's nuclear fusion. \n\nI would also say that a third of the waters of the world did not turn to ""wormwood,"" which is a plant, though who knows if that's what the author is referring to as it doesn't make sense for it to be a plant. \n\nI would say that the supposed translation of Cherynobl as wormwood is an urban legend and not true. \n\nI would say that no men died as a result of drinking the water of Cherynobl, by which I would assume to mean the actual water used in nuclear fission, as any long-term effects would go against the timeline of Revelation. \n\nI would say that the seas did not turn to blood, nor did a great burning mountain fall into the sea prior to the Cherynobl accident as a fulfillment of the second trumpet. \n\nI would even go further and say that, after Cherynobl, that a third of the sun was not ""smitten,"" nor was a third of the moon, nor a third of the stars. As far as I can tell, they're all still there.\n\nI will stop there, as I don't really want to go through all the trumpets, bowls, and scrolls.\n\nSo, that's what I would say about it, if someone tried to use this as proof for Christianity."

"The answer depends on which stories and the context in which you are asking.  Much of the Bible relates true history and has been documented by archealogical study.  Some Bible stories are exactly that, stories.  This doesn't mean they are not true in the theological sense.  They are stories told to relate a truth about God and his relationship with people.  Its like telling a story to illustrate a point.  The story may not be true, but the point the teller is making is true.  The key is to know what kind of story you are reading.  There are histories.  There is poetry.  There are songs.  There are philosophical dissertations.  Many forms of literature appear in the Bible.  When reading remember what the Bible is for.  God is trying to help us to know who he is and how he wants us to be.  If we read looking for the answer to these questions, ""Who is God?"" and ""Who are God's people?"" we will find that the answers found in the Bible are always true."	Society & Culture

They are really two different types of costs.\n \nFixed cost are expenses that do not change in proportion to business activity. (e.g. rent, salaries, capital equipment...)\n\nVariable cost are expenses that change in proportion to business activity.(e.g. raw materials,....)\n\nYou certainly wouldn't want your rent to go up if your business had a good month, or your salary to go down if you had a bad month. Likewise, you wouldn't want the cost of your raw materials to stay the same each month if the demand decreases, so the advantage to converting from fixed to variable costs is that the costs will increase or decrease in proportion to business activity.

Blue tangs do not have any such growth.  However, young unicorn tangs can look much like blue tangs so the aquarium may have mislabeled the fish.  As the unicorn tang grows, a protuberance appears and grows above its eyes.  In the early stages of this growth, the protuberance may look like fungal growth.  The link below has a picture of a unicorn fish with an extensive protuberance.  If the growth was anywhere other than directly above the eyes, as in the linked picture, then it was a parasite which may victimize tangs to the exclusion of other fish.  Many species and genuses of tropical fish have parasites that infect them and them alone - tangs are not known to be particularly parasite prone and are considered to be fairly hardy aquarium fish.

In simpler words: special theory of relativity is just a special case of the general theory!\n\nGeneral theory of relativity deals with accelerated frames of reference. In other words when we have the 'acceleration not equal to zero' (e.g. gravitational acceleration), we use general theory. That is why this is mainly a 'theory of gravity'. One special case for this can easily be when acceleration = 0, and that is the case of special relativity! This is the basic difference between the two theories.\n\nThe other differences could be seen in the postulates of these two theories:\nSpecial theory of relativity postulates:\n1. A frame of reference moving with a constant velocity (i.e., no acceleration) with respect to an inertial frame, is also an inertial frame.\n2. Speed of light in vacuum remains constant in all inertial frames of reference.\n\nGeneral theory of relativity postulates:\n1. In an accelerated frame of reference (with respect to an inertial frame) the spacetime is warped. \nOr, Gravity warps spacetime. \n2. In an accelerated frame of reference (with respect to an inertial frame) the time is dilated. \nOr, Gravity dilates time.\n\n***\nInertial frames: A given region (or coordinate system) where Newton's laws are valid.\nSpacetime: The region in space and time.\nWarped: Distorted\nDilated: Slowed down.

All three are the major bureaus that pretty much every lender uses. You can pay a little extra to get a tri-merged report, which will contain scores from all three. We as mortgage lenders use the middle score to determine what programs my clients qualify for. Keep in mind that when you pull your own report, that you're score will differ than if a lender were to pull it. This is due to the fact that when a creditor pulls your credit, that there is a good chance that they are providing you with credit of some sort, which can bring your score down. That's why, if you have several companies pull your credit, that your score will drop. This is true for all creditors except for mortgage loans and auto loans, since there was a law passed by the Fed's which states that you have a 14 day period in which you can have your credit pulled by multiple lenders and it will only affect your score as if it were only pulled once.\n\nHope this helps.

Great! There is a need for some correction, here is my suggestion:\n\nIch habe viele Hobbys, von Musik-hoeren zu Fussball-spielen. Aber meine liebling Hobby ist schwimmen. Und warum? Weil es ist der groesste Sport das gibt. Wenn jemand schwimmt, sie macht gebrauch von alle seine Muskeln, und viele Kalorien werden verbrannt. Beim Schwimmen, man verwendet eine spezielle Atemtechnik, welche die Lungenkapazität verbessert. Ausserdem ist das Schwimmen auch ein Lebensretter. Die Fahigkeit schwimmen zu können ist nutzlich in Gesundheit sowohl auch als Lebensretter.\n\nGood luck on your exam.	Society & Culture

Yes, but there can be many causes for a stiff knee.  I tore my ACL in high school, and the day after I did it my knee was very swollen, extremely painful, and difficult to bend.  Sprains, strains, frayed meniscis, broken patella, or tears in any of the knee ligaments will cause swelling and lead to stiffness.  If it is painful and feels serious, see your doctor.	Health
Information technology is technology that is involved in the storage, management, manipulation, and communication of information.\n\nOne hundred years ago, if you wanted to remember something, you had to write it down.  You had to file it in a system so that you could remember it.  If anyone else wanted a copy, you had to reproduce it by hand.  If you knew something, like how much weight horses gained when you fed them different ways, you would have to compile the data by hand from several sources.  Interpreting data was difficult for this reason.  And if you wanted to learn something that had to be hands on, like surgery, you often had to travel very far very slowly to see it done in person.\n\nThese days it is possible to store inforation so that it is readily retrievable by many people.  You can examine data more easily.  It is easier to learn things and easier to share what you know.	Science & Mathematics
You have to wear a condom and you must change it when you change partners in your little disgusting party of three. If you have sex with one partner and then don't change the condom and have sex with the other partner you run the risk of infecting the 2nd partner with a STD if the lst partner has one.\n\nMy best answer to this is don't you think you need to settle down and be responsible to these women you are enjoying in bed. Don't have but 1 partner at a time and don't go pick up just any woman and have sex with her because she will allow you too. There is still something to be said for old fashioned morality. If you have a more moral basic kind of life, you will be just as happy as you allow yourself to be.	Health

The way you have to think for a common sense is removed yourself from the subject, you have to think in pure sense. No bias, No emotional judgement, No expertise explaination. When you think something in its purest form then it comes out as common sense. Pure thought is not common, hence as we grow older common sense start going down because all of the biases.. Common sense is pristince natural beauty that  comes with every person mind and starts eroding as biases starts settling in.	Health

Hey, It depends on what you expect in India... If you want to see western style beaches, rocking night life and super smooth transits..... then India is not the place! There was one mention about India being hot, polluted and other crap... Partially true, but heat problem can be offset if you choose a better time to visit, i.e from October to March... The same moron also suggested that you only visit Goa if you plan a trip to India... Plain BS! If u want to enjoy beaches and things like that I suggest you go to Florida or the Carribean! They ll be way better than Goa.... But if you want to know more about your roots, people's life style, some history, architecture, etc then you might want to visit India! Don't expect Canadian politeness from people in India and u ll be in a shock if you do so ( I know about Canadian politeness , cuz I m in Canada rite now)! Cheers if you plan to take a visit!!!

I have been around tennis professionals for quite some time.  I have worked with professionals, I have traveled with professionals, I have given advice to professionals.  At that level of tennis the players are unbelievably talented, I can say without question that it is as close to impossible as you can get.  The odds would be like winning the Super lottery on back to back draws.  That is considering you started with a world class athlete to begin with, and had a team of the best coaches in the world working with him or her 8 hours a day every day.  It would be the same as asking if someone could win a major PGA grandslam event after playing golf for only two years.  For all practical purposes it is impossible, and anyone that says otherwise does not understand the skill level at the professional level.  Anyone that has worked with professionals, i am sure will tell you exactly the same thing.	Sports

"This is a story about a prophet who dared to tell the truth. At the time of this story the Jewish people were divided into 2 kingdoms.  These kingdoms were Judah and Israel. Ahab was the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat was the king of Judah.\n\nJehoshaphat had gone to see Ahab.  Ahab was complaining to Jehoshaphat that the kingdom of Syria had taken some of his land.  The land in question Ramoath at Gilead. Ahab wanted Jehoshaphat to go with him to fight Syria and take back this land.\n\nJehoshaphat said he would go after they asked the advice from a prophet of God.  Ahab was ready with 400 prophets, only these prophets were not true prophets of God.  They were ""yes men"", that is men who said ""yes"" to anything the king wanted.  They also took part in idol worship, so they were not doing what God wanted them to do. When these prophets were asked if they, Ahab and Jehoshaphat, would win this battle they said that they would win, but Jehoshaphat wasn't satisfied and asked Ahab if there was another prophet of God.\n\nAhab told him that yes there was one named Micaiah, the son of Imlah.  King Ahab said, ""I hate him!"" he said he hated Micaiah because he never had anything good to say about him or what he wanted to do.  He said that all that Micaiah had to say about him was evil.  But King Jehoshaphat insisted that Ahab send for Macaiah.\n\nThe men that King Ahab had sent to get Macaiah even told Macaiah what to answer when the king asked for his advice.  When he was asked Micaiah answered what he was told to answer, but he said it in a way that every one would know that he was not telling the truth. This made Ahab angry and he ask him to tell the truth. Then Machaiah answered and told them the truth. He said if they went into this battle Israel would be scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd.\n\nAhab said, ""Didn't I tell you that he wouldn't prophecy anything good about me, but evil? Another one of Ahab's men got so mad that he slapped Macaiah. Then Ahab order the Macaiah be put in prison and fed only BREAD and WATER until he got back.  Macaiah told Ahab that if he came back at all that what he had just told the them was not from God.\n\nWe know that Macaiah was telling the truth and what he said was from God because he was right. What he said would happen happened.    Even though Ahab had disguised himself for the battle he was killed in that battle.\nAs for Jehoshapaht? Some of the Syrian army saw Jehoshaphat in his chariot and chased him mistaking him for Ahab.  Jehoshaphat had to yell out that he was Jehoshaphat and not Ahab or he might have been killed, too.\n\nSometimes it might be hard to tell the truth but we should always tell the truth."

"I don't think so.\n\nThe Rahman story seems to have had a mostly negative impact on the American public's outlook on Afghanistan.  A state which previously had been considered ""cured"" with democracy putting people to death for conversion?  It makes you wonder what the fuck we spent all that money on.\n\nAlso when it comes down to it Bush can't run again.  He doesn't have to build his own approval rating so long as the Republican party stays popular (the Dubai ports deal and immigration are issues the party will continue to criticize Bush for, at least in rhetoric). In this manner they will continue to sign away things like bankruptcy protections (best for credit companies), Tort protections (best for big insurance companies, and no, medical costs won’t go down for most medical work), and immigration law (best for big manufacturing companies).\n\nThe list goes on.  The really disappointing thing is that I doubt things would be very different with any of the popularly known Democrats in power. \n\nRegards,\nArmus"	Politics & Government

Credit reporting agencies are required by law to keep your credit report as accurate as possible.  If there are errors on your credit report you have to write to the credit bureau and request the information be corrected.  If the error is with more than one credit bureau you will have to write to each of them directly to have them investigate the information.  Each of the bureaus keep seperate records so a seperate investigation is required from each bureau.  I suggest writing to the other bureaus (Experian and Equifax) and request they investigate and correct your information.	Business & Finance

"An interesting question.\n\nFirst: I might be completely wrong, and if I am I hope someone comes along and clears this up.\n\nBut: I don't think there is a law that specifically prohibits entrapment.  \n\nHowever: there is a successful defense to a crime if the government enticed the defendant into committing a crime the defendant would not have normally committed.  So, by virtue of the fact that you would be found not guilty if you can prove entrapment, there is, for all intents and purposes, a ""law"" that prohibits it.\n\nI can't tell you what that's based on, but I don't think the Constitution specifically addresses it.

"If you're going to do system restore, then yes you should back up your files.  The first thing to do is to check to see whether you have a writable disk drive.  The front of the disk drive will say CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-RW or something like that.  If you have one of these drives, then you're good to go.\n\nYou have a bunch of options when it comes to backing up.  Either you can back up just the files, or you can back up the entire hard disk.  The benefit to just backing up the files is you save storage space and cost.  The downside is that it'll take a while to find all of the stuff you want to keep if you have it stored in random places.\n\nThe upside of backing up the entire drive (sometimes referred to as ""ghosting"") is that you save everything, but the downside is that it costs more.  You have to use up more disks and get a program that does it (norton ghost for example).  Another drawback to this option is that if you have a virus that you're trying to get away from, you'll ghost that virus to your disk and it will stay with you.\n\nIf you don't have a writable disk drive, then all this is useless anyway.  What I would recommend in that case is get a bunch of free email accounts with providers and email yourself all the files individually or get some free services like yahoo briefcase.  You just have to make sure that no individual file is larger than the allowable attachment or upload size.\n\nThe question of what files you need to save is purely up to you.  Do you really need all those mp3's?  Is it worth it to save your tax information from 1999?  Are your baby photos that important?  hehe.  I would recommend saving everything that is personal.\n\nAs for programs, it gets pretty tough to back those up.  If you don't have the original disks, then you probably won't be able to save those.\n\nAnd no you don't need the original Windows CD to do a system restore (assuming you're using XP...I don't know much about the other versions' system restore capabilities).\n\nRemember: system restore takes you back to a previous point, but it doesn't delete everything.  Everything you had on your computer at the restore point will still be on your computer.  And ALMOST everything after the restore point will be wiped.  Some viruses, worms, trojans, etc. can evade the restore.  So your question of what to save and what to ignore is best answered by what you've put on your computer since your restore point."

"The NCAA rules allow a player 5 years to complete his/her 4 years of eligibility.\n\nA true freshman is someone playing during the first year of eligibility.\n\nA fifth year senior is someone who sat out a year (see red shirt) and is completing the 4th year of eligibility during his/her 5th year in school.\n\nA walkon is someone who was not recruted and given a scholarship. The athlete just showed up, tried out, and was good enough to stay on the team.\n\nA red shirt is an athlete who is passing up a year of play to extend eligibility. Red shirted players are allowed to practice with the team but not take part in competition.\nOriginally, red shirting was allowed if an athlete was injured severly enough to end his season. The team could petition the NCAA for an extra year of eligibilty, and the player was red shirted for the remainder of the year.\nThe name comes from the practice of having injured football players wear a red practice jersey to protect him during practice. \n\nToday redshirting may be done to allow a player to gain an extra year of experience before playing in ""The Big Time"". It also may be done as a personel management tool. If a coach has two equally good players competing for one position as quarterback, one may be redshirted. That way his eligability isn't used up sitting on the bench."	Sports

"The correct title of the book and the movie is ""When Rabbit Howls"" by The Troops for Truddi Chase.  \n\nMultiple Personality is indeed now called ""Dissociative Identity Disorder"" by the mainstream mental health profession.  This occurred in the early 1990s in an attempt to convince the mainstream that multiplicity was not more than one personality in one body, but one personality that was dissociated (split) and needed to be made whole.  \n\nThis, of course, is a matter of perspective.  As long as a person is living a healthy, functional life, it is their right to view themselves as many in one body if they choose to do so.  The Troops for Truddi Chase held this belief and chose not to integrate, and many of today's multiples hold the same belief."	Business & Finance
"The exact cause of stuttering remains to be determined. Recent studies suggest that genetic factors play a role in the disorder. It is thought that many, if not most, individuals who stutter inherit traits that predispose them to develop stuttering. The exact nature of these traits is presently unclear. Whatever the traits are, they obviously impair the individual's ability to string together the various muscle movements that are necessary to produce sentences fluently.\n\nAccording to current thinking, not everyone who is predisposed to stutter will develop the disorder. For many people who are predisposed to stutter, certain life events are thought to ""trigger"" fluency difficulty. One of the triggers for developmental stuttering may be the acquisition of grammar skills. Between the ages of 2 and 5 years, children acquire many of the grammatical rules of language. These rules allow children to transform immature messages (Mommy candy.) into lengthy sentences that require considerable coordination to produce fluently (Mommy put the candy in my backpack.). Thus, a child who is predisposed to stutter may have no difficulty speaking fluently when the sentences he or she produces are all one or two words long. However, when the child becomes capable of producing longer, more complex sentences and then attempts to use such sentences in daily settings, he or she may find that the speech system is not quite up to the challenge - and disfluent speech results.\n\nAfter stuttering has begun, other factors may act to maintain or aggravate fluency difficulty. For example, a child who is easily frustrated may be more likely to tighten or tense speech muscles when disfluencies occur and such tension may increase the length of time a disfluency lasts. Listeners' responses to stuttering (e.g., teasing) can aggravate fluency difficulties as well. Speakers who stutter vary widely in how they react to the disfluencies in their speech. Some appear to be minimally concerned. Others - especially those who have encountered unfavorable reactions from listeners - may develop emotional responses to stuttering that hinder speech production further. Examples of these emotions include shame, embarrassment, and anxiety."	Science & Mathematics

Their dung-and-mud huts are built in a circular pattern and house several dozen women in a thriving and happy village. The women have built a cultural center, a camping site for hikers destined for the nearby Samburu National Reserve, and a business making and selling traditional beadwork necklaces. \n\nIn response local men tried founding their own, men-only village and tourist center. The tourism plan flopped and the men have turned to spying on the women's village, filing a court case to try and shut down the village, and physically attacking the women. The village leader, Rebecca Lolosoli, has even received death threats after attending the recent United Nations world conference on gender. \n\n""We do not have peace in the village now. These men are so angry because we have money and we do not give them any,"" said Lolosoli. \n\n--info from Worldpulse Magazine 7/05, news.telegraph 8/1/05 \n\nnews compiled by Priya Verma, Sara Schoenleber, Carol Anne Douglas, Rachel Pleatman, Jen Mainville, Annsley Chapman, Jennifer Chapin-Harris and Tess Mueting \n\nAfrica News Service, March 24, 2005 pNA \nSpeed Up Empowerment of Women, Kenya Urged. \nFull Text: COPYRIGHT 2005 Africa News Service.
