"It depends....\n\nYou don't say what state you're in.  I succesfully fought a speeding ticket in California.  It took a lot of time and effort and was rather confusing at times, but I prevailed.\n\nI prevailed because the officer at trial didn't provide required documents to prove that the road upon which I was cited wasn't an illegal speed trap.  That meant that the officer was ""incompentent as a witness"" to my speed, and that the court was ""without jurisdiction"" to find me guilty.  (That's in the vehicle code; I didn't make it up.)  Police officers need to follow the rules, too...\n\nIf you're interested in fighting your speeding ticket, look up books from Nolo Press (www.nolo.com).\n\nI fought the ticket because I had nothing but time and nothing to lose.\n\nKeep in mind, in some states, if you go to traffic court and are found guilty, Traffic School isn't an option.\n\nOften, traffic school is the best option."	9

I had a lot of difficult issues to deal with.  One thing that helped a LOT was journalling about them, then analyzing what I wrote to identify the key emotions that were triggered...(fear, helplessness...etc)  I wrote those emotions on pieces of wood (like flat paint sticks), then ritually burned them in a bonfire.\n\nBelieve it or not, it helped...a LOT.  Not that I am no longer plagued by those emotions, whenever they start back up, I imagine the fire, and watching those emotions burn up and float away as smoke.\n\nOther people have done similar things, such as writing the emotions/feelings on a stone, and throwing it into a deep body of water....anything that helps you physically release them is the key, I think.	2
Cops are about 3x's as likely to be involved in domestic abuse than the average profession.  It is usually due to job stresses, rotating shifts, heavy badge syndrom, etc.\n\nIn society, there is a 5/95 rule.  That means that rule, that infers that 95% of all crime is committed by the same 5% of the population. The population of cops is no different.  5% of the cops will have 95% of the complaints.  5% of the cops will be involved in 95% of the domestic violence claims.  \n\nThe best marriages are when a cop marries after he or she is in law enforcment for a while.  The reason is simple, people always change and the job changes them to a greater degree than most other professions.	9

maybe what rev. trask needs is a horn on his head, the guy is and idiot, i cannot imagine anyone wanting this person for their spiritual leader.\n\nDoes the Bible support the existence of unicorns, which are mentioned in some versions?\n\nThe King James, Douay, and other versions, mention unicorns. But that is not so with modern versions that accurately render the Hebrew.—Psalm 22:21; 29:6; 92:10 (21:22; 28:6; 91:11, Douay).\n\n“People once believed that the unicorn’s horn contained an antidote for poison, and during the Middle Ages, powders supposedly made from such horns sold for extremely high prices. Most scholars believe the image of the unicorn was derived from hearsay European accounts of the rhinoceros.” (The World Book Encyclopedia) Certain Assyrian and Babylonian monuments showed one-horned animals. These are now recognized as stags, ibex, cows, and bulls depicted from the side, a view that did not show both horns.\n\nTranslators were long uncertain as to what animal was meant. The Greek Septuagint rendered re´em´ with the sense ‘of one horn,’ or unicorn. The Latin Vulgate often translates it as “rhinoceros.” Other versions use ‘wild ox,’ ‘wild beasts,’ or ‘buffalo.’ Robert Young simply transliterates the Hebrew into English as “Reem,” basically leaving the reader in the dark.\n\nModern scholars, though, have eliminated much confusion over the re´em´. Lexicographers Ludwig Koehler and Walter Baumgartner show that it means “wild oxen,” with the scientific identification Bos primigenius. This is a “subfamily of the large horned ungulate family.” The New Encyclopædia Britannica explains:\n\n“Certain poetical passages of the Old Testament refer to a strong and splendid horned animal called re´em´. This word is translated ‘unicorn’ or ‘rhinoceros’ in many versions, but many modern translations prefer ‘wild ox’ (aurochs), which is the correct meaning of the Hebrew re´em´.”\n\nSince in current English “ox” has the sense of a castrated male, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures consistently and correctly renders re´em´ “wild bull.” The aurochs (wild ox, or bull) seems to have become extinct by the 17th century, but scientists have deduced that it was quite different from the unicorn of legend. The ancient aurochs had a body height of about six feet [1.8 m], and a length of some ten feet [3 m]. It might weigh 2,000 pounds [900 kg], and each of its two horns could be over 30 inches [75 cm] long.\n\nThis certainly accords with the Biblical mention of the re´em´, or wild bull. It was noted for its strength and intractable disposition (Job 39:10, 11) as well as its swiftness. (Numbers 23:22; 24:8) Evidently it had two horns, not one horn like the legendary unicorn. Moses referred to its horns when illustrating the two powerful tribes that would spring from Joseph’s two sons.—Deuteronomy 33:17.\n\nSo the Bible does not support the idea of unicorns as renowned in legend. It does draw an accurate, though limited, picture of the massive and fear-inspiring aurochs, or wild bull, that existed in Biblical times and down into the not-too-distant past.\n\nNO UNICORNS, PROBABLY NOAH WAS WAITING FOR THE TURTLES TO GET ON BOARD	0

Your first answer is interesting since it assumes one learns about history and geography in school.Of course you do, but you learn much more just from research based on your own interests and curiosities. No.The answer is more complex and relates to the chauvinism that seems to characterise the U.S. When we look at the U.S from the outside, as citizens of other places, it is like experiencing a time warp --- the place looks stuck in the 19th century in terms of political and social attitudes.	1

"Here's your answer:\n\n""Here comes Peter Cottontail\nhoppin' down the bunny trail \nHippity hoppity \nEasters on its way!""\n\nThe Easter bunny has its origin in pre-Christian fertility lore. The Hare and the Rabbit were the most fertile animals known and they served as symbols of the new life during the Spring season. \nThe bunny as an Easter symbol seems to have it's origins in Germany, where it was first mentioned in German writings in the 1500s. The first edible Easter bunnies were made in Germany during the early 1800s. And were made of pastry and sugar. \n\nThe Easter bunny was introduced to American folklore by the German settlers who arrived in the Pennsylvania Dutch country during the 1700s. The arrival of the ""Oschter Haws"" was considered ""childhood's greatest pleasure"" next to a visit from Christ-Kindel on Christmas Eve. The children believed that if they were good the ""Oschter Haws"" would lay a nest of colored eggs. \n\nThe children would build their nest in a secluded place in the home, the barn or the garden. Boys would use their caps and girls their bonnets to make the nests . The use of elaborate Easter baskets would come later as the tradition of the Easter bunny spread through out the country.\n\n\n""Oh! here comes Peter Cottontail, \nHoppin' down the bunny trail, \nHippity hoppity\nHappy Easter day"" \n\nTiff"	0

15 lbs in 4 months is a very good pace. . . thats only about 3 or four lbs a month.  Basically you will need to eat about 500 calories less per day than what you need.  So lets say you are 180 lbs, and want to be 165.  you probably want to eat about 1800-1900 calories a day to maintain that weight.  so you want to eat about 1600-1700 day to lose weight gracefully.\n\n3500 calories=1 lbs.  adn to lose 15 lbs in four months, you should try to lose about 1 lb. a week!  Good luck!	2
Although Cromwell had no military training, his experience as a large landowner gave him a good knowledge of horses. Cromwell became convinced that if he could produce a well-disciplined army he could defeat Prince Rupert and his Cavaliers\n\nCromwell trained his cavalry to keep together after a charge. In this way his men could repeatedly charge the Cavaliers. Cromwell's new cavalry took part in its first major battle at Marston Moor in Yorkshire in July 1644. The king's soldiers were heavily defeated in the battle. Cromwell's soldiers became known as the Ironsides because of the way they cut through the Cavaliers on the battlefield.\n\nThe Parliamentary forces were also able to capture the Royalist baggage train that contained his complete stock of guns and ammunition. \n\nThe Battle of Naseby was the turning point in the war. After Naseby, Charles was never able to raise another army strong enough to defeat the parliamentary army in a major battle.	9
"Women's sizes are extremely tricky because they vary alot by manufacturer/designer and cut.  Also, more expensive clothes tend to run larger than cheaper clothes (e.g., a size 8 dress from a more expensive designer might be equivalent to a size 10 dress from a less expensive designer). The other tricky thing is that there are misses sizes and womens sizes.  In many cases, 0-16 is misses and 18+ is womens, but there are some manufacturers who make 18 in both misses and womens and the proportions are slightly different (misses are a little smaller). Here are a couple of examples:\n\nsize 18 misses(from Land's End)\n43"" bust\n36"" waist\n46"" hip\n\nsize 18 womens (from Lands End)\n44.5"" bust\n36.5"" bust\n47"" hip\n\nsize 18 womens (from J Jill, a little more expensive than Land's End)\n44"" bust\n36"" waist\n46"" hip\n\nsize 18 misses (from J Jill)\n43"" bust\n35.5"" waist\n45.5"" hip\n\nsize 18 misses (from Chadwicks, less expensive than Land's End, multiple brands)\n41.5""-43"" bust\n33""-34.5"" waist\n43.5""-45"" low hip\n\nsize 18 womens (Chadwicks)\n42""-43.5"" bust\n34""-35.5"" waist\n44""=45.5"" low hip\n\nMost websites that sell women's clothing will have a size chart--typically it's part of the ""customer service"" page.

"From consumer's side:\nIf you're asked by the goverment to buy a new car and sell your old (which will be hard to sell since noone will buy a car that cannot be used since government restrict the old oil-based car) would you want to do it?

"The word ""latent"" means ""hidden"". Latent energy is the energy required for a substance to change its state. Consider water boiling. The temperature will be constant at 100 degrees Celsius; it will not increase even though energy is being absorbed by the water. This energy is latent energy. It is being used to weaken the inter particle forces. Latent energy however does increase kinetic energy of particles. If it did not do so, particles would not be able to overcome the forces of attraction between them and move away from each other. Substances would not be able to change state."	1

LEAP SECONDS\nCivil time is occasionally adjusted by one second increments to ensure that the difference between a uniform time scale defined by atomic clocks does not differ from the Earth's rotational time by more than 0.9 seconds. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), an atomic time, is the basis for civil time. \nHistorically, the second was defined in terms of the rotation of the Earth as 1/86,400 of a mean solar day.  In 1956, the International Committee for Weights and Measures, under the authority given it by the Tenth General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1954, defined the second in terms of the period of revolution of the Earth around the Sun for a particular epoch, because by then it had become recognized that the Earth's rotation was not sufficiently uniform as a standard of time.  The Earth's motion was described in Newcomb's Tables of the Sun, which provides a formula for the motion of the Sun at the epoch 1900 based on astronomical observations made during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  The ephemeris second thus defined is \n\nFor more click the source link.	1

"People throw the word ""love"" around too loosely.  No one can love a person whom they do not know.  That is lust, not love.  If people would drop petty criteria such as height, weight, skin, hair and eye color, dress, flash and bling and look at how the object of their interest is treating them and others around them, they would experience true and lasting love.  When one knows the value and rarity of real love and appreciates it, then love can be returned to the one who deserves it.  One cannot receive or give what he or she cannot recognize and identify."	8
"For years, Lonnie G. Johnson has been inventing thermodynamics systems for NASA and other organizations; but he has won his greatest fame for re-inventing the squirt gun.\n\nJohnson capped a childhood of tinkering with appliances in his senior year of high school, when he won a national inventing competition for ""Linex,"" a remote-control robot he had built out of junkyard scraps. He went on to more formal training at Tuskegee University, where he earned first a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering (1972) and then an M.S. in Nuclear Engineering (1974). \n\nSoon thereafter, Johnson joined the U.S. Air Force, where he became an Advanced Space Systems Requirements Officer at the headquarters of the Strategic Air Command in Omaha, Nebraska. After directing many projects and earning several decorations, as well as a Nomination for Astronaut Training, Johnson moved on to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. Here he helped develop thermodynamic and controls systems for space projects, including award-winning work for the Galileo Jupiter probe and the Mars Observer project; his crowning achievement at JPL was the Johnson Tube, a CFC-free refrigeration system with a hydraulic heat pump, which later earned Johnson his seventh patent (#4,724,683; 1988). \n\nWhile with the USAF and JPL, Johnson continued to invent at home. In 1985, he founded his own company, later renamed Johnson Research and Development.. Johnson had first conceived his most famous invention in 1982: when a homemade nozzle at his bathroom sink shot a spray of water across the room, Johnson resolved to invent the world's first high-performance, pressurized water gun. \n\nJohnson with partner Bruce D'Andrade finally created a workable prototype of the now famous SuperSoaker® in 1989. They filed for a joint patent (granted 1991) and found a manufacturer, Larami Corp. (now a subsidiary of Hasbro, Inc.). The SuperSoaker® uses an air pump to pressurize its water supply, allowing for tremendous distance and accuracy in water-marksmanship. Those unfamiliar with this product cannot appreciate its popularity: since 1990, over 40 million SuperSoakers® have generated over $200 million in sales; today, dozens of websites are devoted to them. \n\nMeanwhile, Johnson has earned over 40 patents, and continues to invent in the realms of thermo- and fluid dynamics as well as toys. In addition to ongoing controls work for NASA, Johnson and his company are developing an improved home radon detector, a rechargeable battery, and a heat pump that uses water instead of freon, among other projects. \n\nLonnie Johnson has won numerous honors for his success in inventing and entrepreneurship, and his constant encouragement of young people to invent. He is a legendary businessman and public figure in his hometown of Marietta, Georgia---whose Mayor declared February 25, 1994 ""Lonnie G. Johnson Day"" in his honor---and, thanks to the SuperSoaker®, he is a hero to kids nationwide."	3

Go and get some physio therapy on you back and they will also teach you some very good exercises to strenghten your back.\n\nThis will help prevent future back pain and if you do get more back pain it shouldn't last as long if you have been doing the exercises.\n\nI know this beacuse I have painful back episodes myself and have had a lot of therapy over the years.\n\nWhen you feel good you tend to get lazy about exercise so try and keep doing the exercises as it's the only way to prevent or lessen the trouble.	5

I agree with you people should learn the law of their state also they need to know the US Constitution.\nBut, making citizen arrest is easier said then done most people aren't equip to do it physically or mentally.\nIn fact many are still in the learning stage on speaking out of the issue.

Cops are about 3x's as likely to be involved in domestic abuse than the average profession.  It is usually due to job stresses, rotating shifts, heavy badge syndrom, etc.\n\nIn society, there is a 5/95 rule.  That means that rule, that infers that 95% of all crime is committed by the same 5% of the population. The population of cops is no different.  5% of the cops will have 95% of the complaints.  5% of the cops will be involved in 95% of the domestic violence claims.  \n\nThe best marriages are when a cop marries after he or she is in law enforcment for a while.  The reason is simple, people always change and the job changes them to a greater degree than most other professions.	9
No - the oil industry doesn't spend a large percentage of it's money on employees - I am one. \n\nThe money is spent in technology, and processes of actually drilling the well. It costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to drill a single well, and the well spends the better majority of it's life simply paying itself off. \n\nThe only reason the oil companies make alot of money is because the industry is huge. We only make about a 7% profit, when costs are taken into consideration, where bottled water companies make a 75 - 200 % profit margin.	9

"Depends on the person and the job.\nSome jobs you just have to create.\nI met a guy last year who goes around to movie theatres and works on them. He fixes classic theatres and works on the movie projectors. He does design and electrical and even plays movies when he wants to. Plus, he makes a ton a dough. That would be one of my ideal jobs. Possibly not one of yours though.\n\nI would suggest a couple of books.\n1. The classic ""What color is your parachute?""\n2. Discover what your best at.\n\nBoth very helpful books."	6
Many recipes are actually chemical reactions. For example, if you use baking soda in muffin batter, then cook it, you are using the oven's heat to speed the production of carbon dioxide that results from mixing the sodium bicrbonate with water. This produces CO2 gas which makes bubbles that causes the batter to rise.\n\nWhen you marinate meat in a vinegar or wine sauce, the acids in the marinade break down the protein strands in the meat making the meat more tender. \n\nKneading bread dough encourages the development of gluten, which is  made up of chains of proteins. This gives bread elasticity when it is cooked.\n\nCooking is all about chemistry.	1

There is no code. God does not keep secrets. The Bible is very Black and white. It is straight forward. Do not fall into trying to decode. That is the work of Satan.\nAs far as the war, you speak of ...YES! Watch Pastor Hagee he will explain the Bible Prophecy. He does not assume or use his own interpretation of what he imagines. He uses the Bible and explains what the Bible means. He interprets the written word in accordance to Biblical knowledge. He is very well educated. The Bible does teach us that man will destroy himself and the earth. Yes, this will occur when Iran, the Imam, uses nuclear weapons to attack Israel. The Imam believes his mission is to kill the Jews in Israel and then to kill Americans. Today, Iran has been acquiring the Nuclear weapons to complete it's believed to be mission.  China has been helping Iran for the past 2 years, to do so. The explained theory is that Imam and Iranians will first attack the Jews in Israel and then infiltrate bombs into America. God tells us to keep our eye on Israel, when the things come to pass there, as foretold, we are headed for the Holy War. The Jews are God's protected people. We are to treat them with love and respect and honor. The Bible is true. I urge people to read it. To pray and build a personal relationship with the Lord. Live to better the world. The most important thing is not that the world will end or how it ends. The most important thing is how we all live our life both now and eternally. Go forth and teach the saving message of Christ to all nations.\nAs the Bible predicts: There are wars, famine, disease, storms, earthquakes and so on throughout the world. There are social problems and people looking for peace and can not find it. There has come the time that brother against brother and so on. The US is at War in Iraq & Saudi. The US has enemies in many countires. This is a time of turbulenece. When China backs Iran and in turn Iran attcks Israel and the US this will result in a major world war.	0

Ignore the goofball who told you the 7 years starts when you payoff the account, that is wrong.  In fact it is 7 years from when the negative event took place whether it is a late pay or a write off.\n\nA complete credit report from the credit bureau will show the date of any negative items.  If the date is incorrect you can dispute it.\n\nNever ask a collector anything, they have no interest in helping you and often try to get you to send them even a partial payment which will allow them to re-age your account so it shows up for ANOTHER 7 years on your credit report.  \n\nOften collectors will try to collect on debt that is so old that it is beyond the statute of limitations for your state and is legally unenforceble debt.	6

Involuntary muscles are smooth, uninucleated, non-branching muscles that are not directly controllable at will. These include the radially arranged iris muscles, the digestive system, reproductive system, major blood vessels, the skin and internal organs, and are all controlled by the autonomic nervous systemThese muscles are not as free as the voluntary muscles such as your arms legs, fingers, etc..\n\nThe cardiac muscle in heart can be called an involuntary muscle, although it may be classified separately due to its structural differences. it is controlled by nerve impulses produced by a natural pacemaker called the sinoatrial node, the rate of which is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. smooth muscles are found in the digestive system, reproductive system, major blood vessels, the skin and internal organs, and is also controlled by the autonomic nervous system.\n\nSkeletal muscle is under conscious control and is, therefore, voluntary muscle.\n\n voluntary muscles =Somatic nervous system=The somatic nervous system is that part of the peripheral nervous system associated with the voluntary control of body movements through the action of skeletal muscles, and also reception of external stimuli. The somatic nervous system consists of afferent fibers that receive information from external sources, and efferent fibers that are responsible for muscle contraction.\n\nThe somatic system includes all the neurons connected with the muscles, sense organs and skin. It deals with sensory information and controls the movement of the body.\n\nThe basic route of the efferent somatic nervous system includes a two neuron sequence. The first is the upper motor neuron, whose cell body is located in the precentral gyrus (Brodman Area 4) of the brain. It receives stimuli from this area to control skeletal (voluntary) muscle. The upper motor neuron carries this stimulus down the corticospinal tract and synapses in the ventral horn of the spinal cord with the alpha motor neuron, a lower motor neuron. The upper motor neuron releases acetylcholine from its axon terminal knobs and these are received by nicotinic receptors on the alpha motor neuron. The alpha motor neurons cell body sends the stimulus down its axon via the ventral root of the spinal cord and proceeds to its neuromuscular junction of its skeletal muscle. There, it releases acetylcholine from its axon terminal knobs to the muscles nicotinic receptors, resulting in stimulus to contract the muscle.	3

Could mean a lot of different things depending on the context. It could be that the office where your company's payroll gets processed is closing temporarily, like for a holiday. Or maybe you have multiple locations where payroll is processed and they're downsizing by closing a few (but not all) of the locations. Or it could be in reference to the end of the year--- they are closing the year so you need to submit your payroll information a little earlier than usual so they can pay everyone on time and still finish out the annual bookkeeping.

If you study the largest countries and their economic influence in the world what do you see the future calls for?\n\nI see: Languages (Mandarin Chinese; English; and another language - but for sure the first 2); International Business.  You have done the economics - continue but in International Language.  I'd see your counselor and see if you can do your last year maybe in a university overseas that they approve of (accept transcripts). My niece is going to Guangzhou University (Guangzhou used to be Canton) and is studying Mandarin and International Business.  Many students from UK and other countries around the world - they have realized w.the world is heading.  \n\nNext question: WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY?  That is so important. Anymore, remember, companies don't hire you for life - so you have to be motivated, HAPPY, and be willing to move/change be flexible.  \n\nSo a major and a minor is important.\n\nIf you w/not so far along, I'd say fields in medicine that are needed.  For example, in the State of NC we only have 74 pediatric dentists, can you believe?  Also, in the USA, we are hiring nurses from around the world to fill our vacancies. \n\nSo what to do. First and foremost make an inventory of your strengths and weaknesses - you know which they are. BE BRUTAL with yourself - nobody needs to see this list, if you don't want.\n\nNext, list of what you want and definitely don't want out of life - next 5/10 years - can't go further than that.\n\nDo you have a labor department that will give you a census of jobs and what jobs are hard to fill?  We have it in the USA and you could focus on something you like on that list.\n\nIf you have doubts - maybe ask a company tolet you work during the summer/intern to see if this is something that attracts you.\n\nAnother area of concern because we are getting much older and we can't rely any longer on taking care of our elders at home....so that generation will need help - professional help?

You should take the PSAT in 10th and 11th grade...most schools have them in those grades. It gives you an idea what it'll be like, except it doesn't have the writing section like the real test does.\n\nThe real test is very long and the writing part is about 25 minutes which is really short to gather ideas, but oh well...you can't change it so just get good at it. I have problems with math myself, it was where I scored the lowest. But you have to start practicing Algebra and definitely Geometry now if you want to do good. I wish I had paid more attention in Geometry.\n\nIf you decide the SAT is not for you, there's always the ACT, which most schools take. I'd take both...I heard the ACT is easier and more straightforward. I'd take the SAT's at least twice and maybe an ACT. Get an SAT practice book so you know what it's like. Only one test is required though. I'd take one SAT as a junior (June), and one as a senior (October).\n\nStart working hard now, that's my best advice!	3

If you have fatty liver, it can be from drinking heavily or drinking massive amounts of soda.  Most soda uses high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar, this leads to fatty buildup in the liver. Children are more prone to this these days because the soda companies switched from regular fructose to high fructose corn syrup.  If you suspect you have fatty liver, the non alcoholic type NASH or the alchoholic kind, you should have your liver enzymes checked and have your liver looked at on a sonogram.	2

"The word ""latent"" means ""hidden"". Latent energy is the energy required for a substance to change its state. Consider water boiling. The temperature will be constant at 100 degrees Celsius; it will not increase even though energy is being absorbed by the water. This energy is latent energy. It is being used to weaken the inter particle forces. Latent energy however does increase kinetic energy of particles. If it did not do so, particles would not be able to overcome the forces of attraction between them and move away from each other. Substances would not be able to change state."	1
"By a ""slideshow"" I am guessing that you will have a series of still pictures, with the band music in the background.  If so, a CD will work fine.    It's like a Kodak Picture -CD.

They are relatively inexpensive, and no one can accidentally erase your slideshow or  write other data on top of it.   If there are differences between brands, I have not been able to detect it.   I usually use TDK.\n\nMost of the newer DVD players can read picture CD's so you can watch your slideshow on tv's too.\n\nHave fun!"	4

"It would depend on the sense in which you were using it. It's not a common expression in English.  If you were describing the way a garment looked, say, a long white dress, broken at the waist by a pink sash.  If you were speaking of a  vessel, such as a vase, which was damaged at the narrowest point, it could be broken at the waist. It would not be used either way to describe  an anatomical break, I don't think. \nThe only way you could use ""by the waist "" would be to explain a shape altered by the waist."	3

"Women's sizes are extremely tricky because they vary alot by manufacturer/designer and cut.  Also, more expensive clothes tend to run larger than cheaper clothes (e.g., a size 8 dress from a more expensive designer might be equivalent to a size 10 dress from a less expensive designer). The other tricky thing is that there are misses sizes and womens sizes.  In many cases, 0-16 is misses and 18+ is womens, but there are some manufacturers who make 18 in both misses and womens and the proportions are slightly different (misses are a little smaller). Here are a couple of examples:\n\nsize 18 misses(from Land's End)\n43"" bust\n36"" waist\n46"" hip\n\nsize 18 womens (from Lands End)\n44.5"" bust\n36.5"" bust\n47"" hip\n\nsize 18 womens (from J Jill, a little more expensive than Land's End)\n44"" bust\n36"" waist\n46"" hip\n\nsize 18 misses (from J Jill)\n43"" bust\n35.5"" waist\n45.5"" hip\n\nsize 18 misses (from Chadwicks, less expensive than Land's End, multiple brands)\n41.5""-43"" bust\n33""-34.5"" waist\n43.5""-45"" low hip\n\nsize 18 womens (Chadwicks)\n42""-43.5"" bust\n34""-35.5"" waist\n44""=45.5"" low hip\n\nMost websites that sell women's clothing will have a size chart--typically it's part of the ""customer service"" page.

Now if your looking for a good way to raise money, I suggest you have some type of event on the par 3's.  One that seems to do well is having six holes in one green.  You put them all in the same area, make sure they are set up with flags.  The person pays $5.00 and wins a prize if they make birdie.  They get to chose which hole when they putt to.  Since you are going to ride around you could make a list of fines.  Any person or group you catch in the rough, hazard or what ever has to pay a fine of X.  That may be the best way to do it without making up rules that will change the results.	5

"The good kiss would be one that involves the right feeling and the right guy.

Once you both feel comfy and warmed up, you can try using the tongue if you're comfy.\n\nGive him a little hint that you wanna use your tongue by slowly opening your mouth and slowly stick ur tongue in... what I used to do was to suck on his tongue. Also try the ""tongue wrestle""! Can also explore by licking around his teeth and tongue... Some additional stuff you can try are: iced/cold water (the sensation of cold lips on warm is really wow!), cordial drink, soft drink, and also... pop candies! (that popping sensation really feels like fireworks in a passionate kiss!)"	8

"Heracles married King Creon's daughter, Megara. However, Hera drove Heracles into a fit of madness during which he killed his wife and children. Upon realizing what he had done, he fled to the Oracle of Delphi. Unbeknownst to him, the Oracle was guided by Hera. He was directed to serve King Eurystheus for 12 years and perform any task which he required, resulting in The Twelve Labours of Hercules.\n\nThe Twelve Labours (Greek: dodekathlos) of Heracles (Latin: Hercules) are a series of archaic episodes connected by a later continuous narrative, concerning a penance carried out by Herakles, the greatest of the Greek heroes. The establishment of a fixed cycle of twelve labours was attributed by the Greeks to an epic poem (now lost) written by a certain Peisandros of Rhodes, perhaps to be dated about 600 BCE (Burkert).\n\nAs they survive, the Labours of Herakles are not told in any single place, but must be reassembled from many sources. Ruck and Staples (pp 169–170) assert that there is no one way to interpret the labours, but that six were sited in the Peleponnesos, culminating with the rededication of Olympia and six others, part of the same sequence, took the hero farther afield. In each case, the pattern was the same: Herakles was sent to kill or subdue, or to fetch back for Hera's representative Eurystheus a magical animal or plant. ""The sites selected were all previously strongholds of Hera or the 'Goddess' and were Entrances to the Netherworld"" (p 169)."	3

eating healthy has a fair amount of common sense to it. try and eat a balanced diet. your body needs three basic food groups, carbs, fats and proteins. diets like atkins do work but they are extremely bad for you. \neat fruit and salad for vitamins, rice bread potatoes etc for carbs. red meat will give you proteins and fats, white meat will give you proteins and less fat. for fats you can always use olive oil. grilled meat is best for dieting. \nto lose weight take your daily recommended calorie intake, minus about 200 cal from that and then split that amount of calories into 6 meals that you eat regularly through out the day. drink plenty of water. for lunch and dinner take about a fist sized portion of carbs,meat and salad. avoid eating carbs for about 3-4 hrs before you sleep. chew your food for a long time.\nyour exercise programme sounds ok, you could always ask a personnal trainer to give you a structured weighs programme.\nto be completley honest it sounds like you large hips and thighs may be to do with genetics as well. the exercises that you are doing shouldn't really build your thighs but should be toning them. aim to do about 45 mins of cardio work 4-5 times a week.\ngood luck	2

As far as I know, RA is thought to shorten the lifespan of a person by 10 - 15 years.  This is probably due more to the medications you have to take and decreased quality of life and inability to exercise and rest properly that has shortened the lifespan, not the disease itself.  \n\nHowever, with some of the newer biologic meds, like Enbrel, I think this may become less of an issue in the future because damage to the joints can be slowed and prevented, leading to a better quality of life, thereby increasing the quantity. (Just my guess... I'm not a doctor, but it seems logical.)\n\nYou can check out http://www.arthritis.org for info on RA, and there is a very helpful discussion board there as well.	2

"First off you need to ask yourself ""Is this behavior that I have made acceptable view of in my house?""  Kids learn by seeing alot of the time.  Secondly remember that the years 2 & 3 are when children start to assert their independence hence the Terrible Twos.  If it is truly violent behavior do not answer in kind.  The calmer more rational you are the more calm your cild will be.  The energy you would have fed to the situation with anger is not there and it makes the situation smoother.  Now if it is simply taking toys from other children not sharing, biting, etc These are normal things that 3 year olds do.  My son bit a child at school until he broke the skin but the child smaked a toy from his hands very crudely.  And he answered back.  \n\nRemember to break down their behavior slowly and do not try to deconstruct them psychologically.  They are not old enough yet to have severe trauma unless their background dictates it.  Get on your 3 year olds level and speak in small concise words so that he can follow your meaning easier.  Encourage him to express feeling of anger or hurt verbally rather than physically.  When one of my boys has a problem or is upset, I ask ""Does this make you mad, it's okay sometimes to be upset.""  Help them get an outlet and redirect that energy into playing with another item etc.  \n\nI Hope This Helps,\nAmy"	3

People with ancestry from England/Ireland/Scotland/Northern Europe are more likely to have this problem.\n\nAs the fascia thickens, the bands that form can become painful and also pull the fingers into a flexed position. This can be surgically treated by excision of the palmar fascia. This is a detailed big operation, but is safely performed by hand surgeons every day. Dupuytrens contracture can recur after surgery, and the severest form, sometimes referred to as a Dupuytren's diathesis can be rapidly progressive and deforming. Dupuytrens can also be associated with contractures in other fascia, most notably the soles of the feet and a layer of the penis (Sometimes called peyronies disease).\n\nIf you need assessment, be sure you see someone experienced in hand surgery. Many Plastic and Orthopedic surgeons have a special interest in Hand surgery and some have taken an additional year of training to become very proficient in Hand surgery.	2

Its about the Gift of life\n\nThe dictionary says that gift is “something voluntarily transferred by one person to another without compensation.” It also says “a notable capacity.” Zen teachers suggest that the miracle isn’t to be able to walk on air or water. Rather, the miracle is to simply walk on the earth. How often we overlook what is directly underfoot by trying to see what is out of view and considered by some to be higher or greater! Our everyday situation is the gift we are given. Are we able to hold it gently, thankfully, and peacefully? Even if our everyday situation doesn’t look like what we think it should look like?	3

"Honestly, I would stay away from the “wholesaler’s” game. What once was a great idea has now spread so everyone and their mother is doing it. Margins are razor thin at best and I suspect non-existent when you factor in most drop shippers or wholesale clubs ""Membership fees"" along with eBay and PayPal's cut.\n\nTake something that you're knowledgeable about and wait for a bargain. For example, lets say you know a lot about cars and one weekend you stumble across a shop having a clearance sale - $200 car radio's for $30 bucks (or whatever). Take it home and list it for $75. Your customer thinks they saved $125 bucks and you made $45. Now multiply it by 100 sales and you are in business. I do about $2K a month in sales and I profit about $500 and that’s from just working part time. It's not ""easy money"", you do have to work at it, but if you're willing to invest the time and effort, you can do it."	4

I take Atenolol for mvp.  It's a beta blocker that's usually used to lower blood pressure.  I do have mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and this takes some of the strain off my heart so it doesn't try to overcompensate.

LOL.. No, that is not how it works. At this time we have an abundance of natural resources. More than enough for everybody to have a decent standard of living. In fact we waste more natural resources worldwide than we actually use. The poorest nations being often the biggest wasters. \n\nThe concept that all should just be instantly shared with everybody has allure for the scared and desperate. The lulling thought that you will always be taken care of. That some devine fairness will magically appear in a species which has always in the past had to work so hard to establish fairness and justice. Hate to bust your bubble but it aint going to happen. People are people and communist systems like that breed corruption even faster than other systems. Think about it this way. You have a computer, which is something the majority of the world doesn't.  Should they not chop up the parts in your computer to pay for food in a nation that used to produce excess food until a corrupt Government took over and destroyed the agricultural system?  Should you be responsible for the mistakes made in another nation which you personally and your nation had nothing to do with? \n\nIn reality barter/trade is the fairest system we've yet devised. Taking something away from somebody will only instill hostility and bitterness. It doesn't make the person you give it too any more wealthy. It just makes all poor. Instead of some being miserable all are miserable except for an elite core which replaces the rich with an even deeper and less challlengble elite caste. So in the end all your suggestion accomplishes if it were implimented is to remove all chance you personally have of gaining wealth. It will make life even less fair. It will make the poor poorer as redistribution is both an incentive not to produce and costs resources which means there is still less left to go around. \n\nYou want to help the poor then help them learn self sufficiency and fight corruption wherever you find it. Corruption is the main cause of poverty. It is injustice embodied. A bribed politician is the cancer of civalization.	9

"Very solid advice from the poster above; a lot varies by what you want to study.  The UCAS route is definitely the first step to identifying where you could go with those grades.\n\nNext, is more important, though.  Go and SEE the places; go to as many open days and events as you can, and go and visit towns that you're interested in on non-event days too.  It's far more important to go to a university where you're going to be comfortable and happy than to go to one which is slightly ""better"" officially, so make sure you take time and find somewhere you like and will be happy (and hence work well) at."	3

The birth starts with the onset of labour, which is usually marked by the beginning of regular uterine contractions. These are felt as tightenings either in the back or across the top of the womb. Sometimes the baby's waters break before the beginning of the contractions or, more commonly, once labour is under way. \nA mucous show is often passed through the vagina at the beginning of labour, which may have streaks of blood in it. Some women pass the show days before going into labour, other women do not pass a show at all, so it is not a reliable sign of labour. \n\nDuring a natural birth, the muscles in the uterus (womb) contract and it's this contraction that's felt as labour pains. Labour is a painful experience, but breathing techniques learned in antenatal classes can make early labour less stressful. \n\nThe contractions cause the baby's head to be pressed down through the pelvis and against the inside of the cervix. This causes the cervix to stretch open (dilate) allowing the baby's head to pass through (descend) into the vagina and onwards into the outside world. \n\nThe birth begins when labour contractions start becoming frequent, intense and of sufficient duration to cause the cervix to open. At the beginning of labour, you will usually be examined externally (abdominal examination), to see how the baby is lying and to be certain that the baby is coming head first. \n\nWhen labour starts, the cervix gets shorter (a process called effacement) and opens (dilates). The cervix is fully dilated when it has opened 10cm. During labour, it's important you don't start pushing before you are fully dilated, because there will be a danger of tearing the cervix. \nOnce your cervix has fully dilated, the first stage of labour is completed and the second stage is about to begin. The first stage generally lasts up to 12 hours in a first labour and seven hours in subsequent deliveries, but each labour is different. \nThe second stage starts when your cervix is completely open (10cm). Usually, there is a sensation of fullness in your vagina or bowel and you wish to push. \n\nMost women will find that the labour pains in the second stage of labour are more bearable, because you can now actively help yourself by pushing. \n\nThe second stage of labour ends with the delivery of the baby. It usually lasts for 45 minutes to two hours in a first labour and 15 to 45 minutes in subsequent deliveries. \nDuring this stage the afterbirth (placenta) is delivered. The placenta is usually delivered within 5 to 15 minutes after the birth of the baby. \n\nThe last stage of birth is a co-operation between yourself and the midwife, although little effort is required to deliver the placenta.\n\nAfter your baby's born, it's routine that you will be given an injection to stimulate the uterus to contract, which helps delivery of the placenta. \n\nMaking the uterus contract in this way reduces the risk of heavy bleeding during delivery of the placenta (post-partum haemorrhage).	2

"For most of the twentieth century, coffee was decaffeinated with dichloromethane, CH2Cl2. Dichloromethane selectively dissolves caffeine without carrying off sugars, peptides, and flavor ingredients, so it removes coffee's buzz without changing its taste. However, it is somewhat toxic, and when evidence suggested that it might be carcinogenic, its use was sharply curtailed.\n\nEthyl acetate was used as a replacement for dichloromethane during the 80's and early 90's. Although it too is moderately toxic, coffee makers touted ethyl acetate as ""natural"" because it was present in fruit.\n\nA nontoxic and more environmentally benign solvent than either dichloromethane or ethyl acetate is now used: supercritical fluid carbon dioxide. \n\nWhen a sealed vial containing both gaseous and liquid carbon dioxide under high pressure is heated, the liquid density drops while the gas density rises. If the pressure is above 72.8 atm, and the temperature rises above 304.2 K, the density of the liquid and the density of the gas become identical. The meniscus between the liquid and gas phases vanishes. The carbon dioxide becomes a supercritical fluid which has both gaslike and liquidlike properties. The fluid fills the container like a gas, but can dissolve substances like a liquid. Supercritical fluid carbon dioxide is an excellent nonpolar solvent for many organic compounds, including caffeine.\n\nThe extraction process is simple. Supercritical carbon dioxide is forced through green coffee beans. Its gaslike behavior allows it to penetrate deep into the beans, and it dissolves 97-99% of the caffeine present. The caffeine is valuable, and coffee manufacturers usually try to recover it. The caffeine-laden CO2 is sprayed with high pressure water and caffeine is then isolated by a variety of methods, including charcoal adsorption, distillation, recrystallization, or reverse osmosis.\nReferences\n\nO'Brien, M.J., Spence, J.E., Skiff, R.H., Vogel, G.

"From consumer's side:\nIf you're asked by the goverment to buy a new car and sell your old (which will be hard to sell since noone will buy a car that cannot be used since government restrict the old oil-based car) would you want to do it?

Will I be able to produce it on a reasonable price because researching the new technology would need cost?\n\nFrom government side:\nWould this shift affect the country's relationship with other countries cause we don't buy their oils anymore? Would this shift worth as much as the cost needed?\n\nFrom fuel producer side:\nWell, the whole country has have gas station for oil, I've made a lot of investment on that, would I buy a whole new gas station kit for alternative fuel for the whole country's gas station that I have?

"I too started to learn Spanish as a second language and I was terrified of making a mistake. I actually lived in Venezuela for 8 months and hardly spoke any, mostly listened (I had a translator too). But then I came back to the States and started to just use the words that I had learned from listening. Yes, it can be embarrasing, but the Spanish culture is very different from American and they are very nice about helping you to learn. They are unlikely to laugh at you. They may laugh with you, but never at you. My grammar is still all messed up, but with practice, it is easy to learn more and more. And they are usually happy to help you learn more, or how to say it correctly.\n\n(Also watch it because a word in English can have many meanings and does not directly translate in Spanish the same. For example they have no differientiation between ""do"" and ""make"" - they use the same basic word. What I mean is they tell you what it means, use it in that way, and dont assume that it has other definitions, as it would in English)\n\nGood luck!!!"	0

"I don't go to church, even though I believ in God, and Jesus Christ, because I was tired of going to church and listening to people talk about how they are a better christian than someone else.

If God is everywhere why do I have to go to church to worship Him?  Can't I go up to the mountains where I can see His work, and worship on my own there?  I have a beautiful wife and a baby boy.

Does anyone else think it odd that televangelists and some real preachers are driving around in Cadillacs and Mercedes', and BMWs?  While their ""flock"" drives clunkers. I know not all are like that, but you get my idea.   I believe in God.  I've lost faith in the church."	0

Could mean a lot of different things depending on the context. It could be that the office where your company's payroll gets processed is closing temporarily, like for a holiday. Or maybe you have multiple locations where payroll is processed and they're downsizing by closing a few (but not all) of the locations. Or it could be in reference to the end of the year--- they are closing the year so you need to submit your payroll information a little earlier than usual so they can pay everyone on time and still finish out the annual bookkeeping.  Could you please give more detail about how this statement was made?	6

There are plenty of people willing to do that stuff in this country.  Get the people off of welfare and get them to start picking the veggies.  Another problem is that the immigrants do those jobs and get paid little for thier hard work.  Personally I think they should allow who is already here to stay but make the law that anyone else will be deported.  People that are already here and have lives here should not be made to leave.\n\nP. S. I am available to pick veggies but I will not accept less than 8 dollars an hour.  That is hard work.	9
You are right, it shows that their vocabulary is limited.\nHowever the media, mainly pop records has made it acceptable to restrict ones own use of words. I consider it to be demeaning to womankind.

"It would depend on the sense in which you were using it. It's not a common expression in English.  If you were describing the way a garment looked, say, a long white dress, broken at the waist by a pink sash.  If you were speaking of a  vessel, such as a vase, which was damaged at the narrowest point, it could be broken at the waist. It would not be used either way to describe  an anatomical break, I don't think. \nThe only way you could use ""by the waist "" would be to explain a shape altered by the waist."	3

"How to Install a Wireless Network by CNET\n\nStep 1:\nGetting started\nA broadband connection brings the Internet into your home at blazing speeds. And with a wireless, or Wi-Fi, network, you can get that access on multiple computers throughout your home--and even outside it--without cords. What's more, today's wireless-networking products make broadband Internet sharing easy, inexpensive, and secure. In this Weekend Project, we'll show you how to distribute broadband Internet access among multiple notebook or desktop systems, and we'll walk you through the necessary steps to keep your network protected.\n\nThe core of a Wi-Fi network is a wireless router or gateway. We used the D-Link DI-624 AirPlus Xtreme G 802.11g router, which sells for $99 before a $20 rebate. You'll also need a wireless adapter for each system that connects to the network. We installed two D-Link AirPlus Xtreme G 802.11g wireless adapters: a DWL-G650 PC Card adapter for a Windows 2000 notebook PC ($65 before a $10 rebate) and a DWL-G520 PCI adapter for a secondary desktop running Windows XP Home Edition ($69 before a $10 rebate). The primary PC, connected to the router via an Ethernet cable, was running Windows XP Professional.\n\nStep 2:\nWhat you'll need\nBefore you get started with this project, we recommend that you have the following:\n\n* A wireless router\n* Wireless adapters and/or a wireless-enabled system or laptop\n* A broadband connection to the Internet (typically via cable or DSL modem)\n* An Ethernet cable\n* Pen and paper to write down current network settings, such as IP and MAC addresses\n\n* The IP address assigned to your system by your ISP if you use a static IP address\n* If you use DSL, the username and password assigned to you by your ISP\n* The MAC address for all wireless network adapters\n\nStep 3:\nPrepare for installation\nYou may need a few bits of information to set up your router correctly. Double-click the Network Connections icon within Control Panel and right-click the icon for your PC's Ethernet adapter. Then choose Properties > Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) > Properties. If ""Use the following IP address"" is highlighted, your Internet access uses a static IP address. Jot down the IP address, the subnet mask, and the default gateway. Then click ""Obtain an IP address automatically."" Click OK to apply your changes and OK again to close the dialog.\n\nYou'll find your Ethernet adapter's IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway within its Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties.\nYou'll find your Ethernet adapter's IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway within its Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties.\nYou'll find your Ethernet adapter's IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway within its Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties.\n\nIf you have a DSL connection, you'll probably need the username and the password your system requires to connect to your ISP. If you don't know the values, try looking within the software your ISP provided. You may need to uninstall the PPPoE connection software that your ISP provided. To find out, check your router's documentation.\n\nNow is also a good time to collect the MAC addresses of any wireless-network adapters you'll be installing. The MAC address should be printed on the Wi-Fi PC Card or the PCI adapter.\n\nStep 4:\nInstall the router\n\nConnect your modem to the WAN port on the router and your PC to an open Ethernet port on the router.\nConnect your modem to the WAN port on the router and your PC to an open Ethernet port on the router.\n\nMost DSL users will probably need to choose a PPPoE connection type.\nMost DSL users will probably need to choose a PPPoE connection type.\nBefore you install the router, power down your PC and modem, then disconnect the Ethernet cable from your PC and connect it to your router's WAN port so that the Ethernet cable connects the modem to the route"	4
Go and get some physio therapy on you back and they will also teach you some very good exercises to strenghten your back.\n\nThis will help prevent future back pain and if you do get more back pain it shouldn't last as long if you have been doing the exercises.\n\nI know this beacuse I have painful back episodes myself and have had a lot of therapy over the years.\n\nWhen you feel good you tend to get lazy about exercise so try and keep doing the exercises as it's the only way to prevent or lessen the trouble.	5

Ignore the goofball who told you the 7 years starts when you payoff the account, that is wrong.  In fact it is 7 years from when the negative event took place whether it is a late pay or a write off.\n\nA complete credit report from the credit bureau will show the date of any negative items.  If the date is incorrect you can dispute it.\n\nNever ask a collector anything, they have no interest in helping you and often try to get you to send them even a partial payment which will allow them to re-age your account so it shows up for ANOTHER 7 years on your credit report.  \n\nOften collectors will try to collect on debt that is so old that it is beyond the statute of limitations for your state and is legally unenforceble debt.	6

Also try the ""tongue wrestle""! Can also explore by licking around his teeth and tongue... Some additional stuff you can try are: iced/cold water (the sensation of cold lips on warm is really wow!), cordial drink, soft drink, and also... pop candies!

"I agree with you and most of the comments thus far.  Immigration is wonderful.  \n\nThere are laws, policies and procedures that govern Legal immigration.  Please, everyone who wants to come to this great land, come join the fun.  Just do it legally.\n\nThe laws may not be working perfectly.  The good news is that we have a way to change the laws legally.  As voters, we need to get to the pools and elect legislatures that will vote the way we want them to regardless of the subject.  The U.S. has one of the largest apathetic voter pools in the world, yet most will sit back and blame the government when they as a voter have done nothing to shape the government.\n\nWe all also need to return to 9th grade Civics class.  The president is ONE man.  The laws are written and approved by Congress before they reach his desk.  Congress also provides all the money and support for the presidents plans, yet the congressional candidiates receive the least amount of publicity.  They just get re-elected over and over until their term limit hits.  We need to clean house, and I mean clean ""House"", and ""Senate"" when I say that.\n\nOther than that I don't feel too strongly about the subject, maybe you are a racist, I don't know."	9

"Prior to the 12th, whomever received the most electoral votes was president and whomever received the next largest number was vice-president. In 1796, the president and vice-president elect were from different parties, causing some difficulties in governing.

The 12th allowed candidates to run as a president and vice-president ""team"" specifying which office each candidate sought and was electable to."	3
"i was bulimic for eight years.started in school and i just didnt want to stop after that.its so easy eating chocolates and fatty food and throwing it all up after that.i loved the pleasure food gave me,but always rem it starts from the mind.its all up to you.i didnt take pro help but was disgusted i gained 20 pounds when i tried stopping.\ni am cured now,it wasnt diffcult getting back to normal.i believe if you want to you will.i exercise 4 times a week and never exeed 1400 calories. i m not skinny but healthy and prob stay this way for a bit.\noh i cheated last nite...ate endless bars of chocolates and a tub of ice cream....blamed it on depression.automatically threw some of it up....your body has a reflex action after some time.relax.we are all human.\n\nBulimia is often less about food, and more to do with deep psychological issues and profound feelings of lack of control. Binge/purge episodes can be severe, sometimes involving rapid and out of control feeding that can stop when the sufferers ""are interrupted by another person or when their stomach hurts from over-extension. This cycle may be repeated several times a week or, in serious cases, several times a day.\n\nTreatment is most effective when it is implemented early on in the development of the disorder. Unfortunately, since this disorder is often easier to hide and less physically noticeable, diagnosis and treatment often come when the disorder has already become a static part of the patient’s life. Historically, those with bulimia were often hospitalized to end the pattern and then released as soon as the symptoms had been relieved. However, this is now infrequently used, as this only addresses the surface of the problem, and soon after discharge the symptoms would often reappear as severe, if not worse, than when they had originally been.\n\nThere are several residential treatment centers across the country, which offer long term support, counseling, and symptom interruption. The most popular form of treatment for the disorder involves some form of therapy, often times group psychotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy. Anorexics and bulimics typically go through the same types of treatments and are members of these same treatment groups. This is because anorexia and bulimia often go hand in hand, and it is not unlikely that one has at some point participated in both. Some refer to this as ""symptom swapping"". These forms of therapy address both the underlying issues which cause the patient to engage in these behaviors, as well as the actual food symptoms as well. In combination with therapy, many psychiatrists will prescribe anti-depressants or anti-psychotics"	2
What you are referring to is probably Dupuytrens contracture. This is a genetically related trait which causes thickening and lumps in the palmar fascia( a layer of the hand). People with ancestry from England/Ireland/Scotland/Northern Europe are more likely to have this problem.\n\nAs the fascia thickens, the bands that form can become painful and also pull the fingers into a flexed position. This can be surgically treated by excision of the palmar fascia. This is a detailed big operation, but is safely performed by hand surgeons every day. Dupuytrens contracture can recur after surgery, and the severest form, sometimes referred to as a Dupuytren's diathesis can be rapidly progressive and deforming. Dupuytrens can also be associated with contractures in other fascia, most notably the soles of the feet and a layer of the penis (Sometimes called peyronies disease).\n\nIf you need assessment, be sure you see someone experienced in hand surgery. Many Plastic and Orthopedic surgeons have a special interest in Hand surgery and some have taken an additional year of training to become very proficient in Hand surgery.	2

No - the oil industry doesn't spend a large percentage of it's money on employees - I am one. \n\nThe money is spent in technology, and processes of actually drilling the well. It costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to drill a single well, and the well spends the better majority of it's life simply paying itself off. \n\nThe only reason the oil companies make alot of money is because the industry is huge. We only make about a 7% profit, when costs are taken into consideration, where bottled water companies make a 75 - 200 % profit margin.	9

You have a brilliant and enquiring mind.  There are many people who believe in exactly that sort of thing... but there are many other ideas, and who can say what is the right answer/ idea.  Reincarnation is well known, some folk believe in ghosts.  I knew a woman once who believed that walls (and other things) absorbed and recorded every sound, and she could make them play back!  I met a man who firmly believed that everyone fought evil/ death in their sleep each night (and that eventually everyone loses the battle).  Have you heard about prana, or breath?  The life force is breath -- it leaves you dead as a last breath (the soul), and prana yoga is a set of exercises that gets breath chi to  more places more efficiently so you feel better and live longer. Some people believe we are all one, so we can connect with things and with each other.  They can move things by thought (telekinesis) and levitate!  However, some people reckon this explains a fondness for a favourite chair or toy, a relationship with a quirky automobile, and affinity with other people -- friends and loved ones.\n\nSo yes, they might well be a better fit as your parents than your actual parents, and you may be right -- maybe they should have been your parents.  On the other hand, maybe they were your parents in a previous life.  Or what if you just knew them in a previous life?\n\nMaybe there's a cosmic law that stops you getting the same parents each reincarnation???  Who knows!\n\nMaybe God gave you the parents you have now as a lesson or even as a punishment lol! \n\nMaybe your parents don't suit you just now -- but who's to say that will always be the case.  maybe God knows that in the future, some years ahead, you will need THESE particular parents for some particular reason.\n\nIn the meantime, keep on thinking, inquiring and write up a diary -- maybe you will be a brilliant author one day!	8

"Well the lettering and borders are pretty easy to do. Do you have ""TurboLister""? If not, then you should definitely get turbo lister, maybe do a search for it on ebay and download it, especially if you sell alot on ebay. TurboLister makes it really easy. Whenever you do a listing, it is like writing an email, and you can center, change font style and color, add a border that goes with your item, or a holiday border. Good luck!"	4
This one is really gonna depend on the person and the circumstances. Life will always have it's ups and downs, but a thing to really be aware of and look out for is depression. \n\nYou can tend to look toward how much worse off some others are than you and your circumstances to give you a better perspective on things. \n\nOn the other hand if you tend to compare your life now to how much better it was prior to this, then you may be setting yourself up to not be happy even when things turn around (as they will usually).\n\nLook at the things that are going well, build on them and do what you can to change the things that aren't so wonderful.\n\nSince I don't know the specifics, perhaps you could find others with the same problem or difficulties to talk with about this?\n\nGood luck and my best wishes for you.	2

"Many insects orient their lives with the position of the sun,\nsuch as bees.

"I don't go to church, even though I believ in God, and Jesus Christ, because I was tired of going to church and listening to people talk about how they are a better christian than someone else.  God is the only one who can judge us. All these people talking about how good they are... I don't need that.  Also, I feel that we need to read between the lines of many things in the bible.  Ways change.  Just because it was like 2000+ years ago, doesn't mean that it has to be that way now.  Many things in the bible are the way they are for societal reasons. Not because God ""said so."" The bible was written by men, and is then questionable. The easiest way to get people to do or not do something, is to make it ""Holy Law."" If I'm passing on, orally, the bible and I feel like saying you can't eat pigs, because I think they are dirty.  Whose to stop me from saying, ""God, said this!""  If God is everywhere why do I have to go to church to worship Him?  Can't I go up to the mountains where I can see His work, and worship on my own there?  I have a beautiful wife and a baby boy.  I can see God's work right there.  I don't need to go to church have someone tell me, about His work.  Why am I going to give money to the church ""for God?"" God doesn't need money. Does anyone else think it odd that televangelists and some real preachers are driving around in Cadillacs and Mercedes', and BMWs?  While their ""flock"" drives clunkers. I know not all are like that, but you get my idea.   I believe in God.  I've lost faith in the church."	0

eating healthy has a fair amount of common sense to it. try and eat a balanced diet. your body needs three basic food groups, carbs, fats and proteins. diets like atkins do work but they are extremely bad for you. \neat fruit and salad for vitamins, rice bread potatoes etc for carbs. red meat will give you proteins and fats, white meat will give you proteins and less fat. for fats you can always use olive oil. grilled meat is best for dieting. \nto lose weight take your daily recommended calorie intake, minus about 200 cal from that and then split that amount of calories into 6 meals that you eat regularly through out the day. drink plenty of water. for lunch and dinner take about a fist sized portion of carbs,meat and salad. avoid eating carbs for about 3-4 hrs before you sleep. chew your food for a long time.\nyour exercise programme sounds ok, you could always ask a personnal trainer to give you a structured weighs programme.\nto be completley honest it sounds like you large hips and thighs may be to do with genetics as well. the exercises that you are doing shouldn't really build your thighs but should be toning them. aim to do about 45 mins of cardio work 4-5 times a week.\ngood luck	2

"My favorite X-Men comic character is Iceman.  I suppose because he reminds me a lot of my favorite Marvel character of all time, Spider-Man.  Both characters have their serious side, but are still witty, even in a fight.  As you can imagine, I enjoyed watching ""Spider-Man & His Amazing Friends"" as a kid.  I really don't think Iceman, or most of the original X-Men lineup for that matter, have ever been given fair treatment in the movies.\n\nAs far as characters I'd like to have seen in the films, I will use the last member of the ""Amazing Friends"" I've yet to mention, Firestar.  Granted, she didn't appear in a comic book until well after her TV debut, but I would still like to see this ""hottie"" included in an X-Men movie.  Since Pyro is in the movies, having the two of them face off would be interesting, to say the least.  If Firestar created flames, one would have to wonder if Pyro could take control of them & turn them against her allies."	7

Targeted cover letter\nThis type of letter has immense potential for getting the interview since it is normally sent for an advertised position. You are able to highlight your skills and experience that match the job requirements and motivate why you are the perfect person for the job. It is also called a response letter. \n\nRecommendation cover letter \nThis type of letter produces the best results since you and the company already has something in common. You share an acquaintance. It is used when you have been referred to the enterprise by someone reputable. Make sure that you mention the person's name within the first paragraph of your letter. It is also called the network letter. Always try to get a referrer because it enhances the possibility of getting the job. \n\nReport back cover letter It is also called a follow-up on a previous letter or interview. It may seem desperate but if your wording is correct, it can show determination and attention to detail. It works the same as following up on a sales lead and brings your application to the attention of the recruiter. Use this letter three or more days after an interview to show your interest, highlight skills, and to thank the recruiter for the interview. Try to mention skills and experience that you may have missed during an interview. Do not repeat the information from your first cover letter. It must be fresh and original. \n\nMany recruiters feel that job seekers send cover letters to a broad audience. They are looking for targeted and original letters. The person who receives the letter must think that you are writing specifically for him. It must motivate the recruiter to call you for an interview or job offer. \n\nmore on http://www.cvtips.com/cover_letter_types.html	6

That's the part where the new nail is growing- underneath the existing nail.  It is white, because it is not laying against the skin, as the rest of the nail is.  The skin has blood vessels under it, which tint the skin pink, which is why that part of the nail is pink.  If you notice, the end of the nail is white, too, because that is no longer laying on skin.	3

"Neither!!!! Maybe that's why I am still single, but I am waiting for the guy that is nice and can rock my world. Settling for Mr. Sex can lead to heartache and Mr. Nice guy probably gets a lot of girls married but it's probably why there is so much cheating going on. Women settle then can't contain themselves when the one they should have waited for comes along. I also think this is why women get accused of being much less interested in sex than their husbands. They settle for Mr. Nice guy but the sex sucks so it's ""honey I got a headache"" when it comes to booty time. I rather be alone than in bad (Mr. sex) or lousy (Mr. Nice guy) company."	8
a teddy bear, they are adorable and people cuddle them, however if you are a snoopy doll, you might be a collectable and just sit there on the shelf, waiting for your day, watching the furry lovable, teddy bear get cuddled while you collect dust, sure maybe an ooohh or ahhh every once in a great while from a fan, but where is the deal love. The hug tight at night, the being drooled on and rolled over on when they fall asleep... Then as a Snoopy you sit, angry, bitter, but unable not to smile, until one day your rage and jealousy of the teddy bear take hold, and then... i don't want to be that teddy bear. So my answer is, i would prefer to be a teddy bear, unless there was a snoopy collectable in the house.	6
