Malala, of course, is already well-known. After being shot by the Taliban in 2012 for trying to educate herself, she courageously spoke up even louder. ""They can only shoot a body; they cannot shoot my dreams,"" she said. Satyarthi, meanwhile, leads a consortium called the Global March Against Child Labor, a cause he's been championing for decades. There's a lot wrong with the world, and the committee's inspired choice is a reminder -- and a challenge -- that we can all do more to make it a better place."	POLITICS
