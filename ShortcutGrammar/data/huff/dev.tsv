"An important new study released this morning by Travel Effect found that 40 percent of American workers will leave paid vacation days unused. The four reasons cited the most are the dread of returning from a vacation to piles of work (40 percent), the belief that no one will be able to step in and do their job for them while they're gone (35 percent), not being able to afford it (33 percent) and the fear of being seen as replaceable (22 percent). ""Americans suffer from a work martyr complex,"" said Roger Dow, President and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association. ""In part, it's because 'busyness' is something we wear as a badge of honor."" Clearly, we need to work harder about working smarter -- by not working all the time. The ""work martyr"" complex needs to go the way of the Dictaphone, typewriter and green eyeshades as relics of the workplace of the past (okay, I like typewriters, but you get the idea)."	2	TRAVEL

"DAVOS, SWITZERLAND -- This week, while candidates ""squirmished"" in advance of Iowa, more than 2,000 global leaders gathered here for the World Economic Forum. The theme was The Fourth Industrial Revolution -- the coming era of automation and smart technology -- and what business can do to help meet the big challenges ahead of us. The dominant refrain was the need for business leaders to put purpose at the center of the definition of business itself. It's a shift, already underway, with the power to not only improve the world but also boost the bottom line. As Unilever CEO Paul Polman put it, ""investing in the common good, investing in the long term, is a better investment than just your short-term self-interest."" What came through loud and clear this year was a growing realization that companies that chase short-term profits at the expense of social responsibility won't last very long. It's not just a better and more enlightened way forward; it's the only way forward."	1	POLITICS

"This week, we lost Joan Rivers, who died on Thursday, at 81-years-young (as Sarah Silverman tweeted: ""She wasn't done.""). Rivers was a true trailblazer. Known now for the red carpet, she began with the glass ceiling, shattering it by telling-- and sometimes shouting -- unspoken truths. ""A girl, you're 30-years-old, you're not married -- you're an old maid,"" she said, satirizing the prevalent culture. ""A man, he's 90-years-old, he's not married -- he's a catch!"" That was 1967 on the Ed Sullivan Show. ""My act spoke to women who weren't able to talk about things,"" she said. ""I was talking about things that were really true."" And she never stopped. Through all her iterations, struggles, ups and downs, there was never anything fake about her -- except for her plastic-surgery-altered face, which, of course, she gleefully lampooned. Asked what she wanted on her tombstone, she replied: ""She had a great time."" As did we."	1	POLITICS
"The ""conservative"" justices on the Roberts Court are often passionately restrained in their interpretation of the Constitution in precisely the cases in which a more muscular form of judicial review is most appropriate -- those involving discrimination against African Americans, women, Hispanics, religious dissenters, gays and lesbians, persons accused of crime, and denial of the right to vote to minorities and the poor. In these cases, our contemporary ""conservative"" justices often err on the side of upholding laws that even Philip Kurland would have found unconstitutional.

"This week provided some notable examples of Crime and Punishment in modern America. First, football star Ray Rice received a two-game suspension for knocking unconscious his then-fianc√©e in a hotel elevator. His coach promptly proclaimed Rice ""a heck of a guy."" Earlier in the week, Lane Johnson, another NFL player, was suspended four games for taking a performance enhancing drug -- a transgression apparently twice as bad, in the NFL's eyes, as beating up your soon-to-be-wife. In Arizona, the execution of murderer Joseph Wood went seriously awry, leaving him gasping for air for close to two hours before dying. Despite this grotesque death, Gov. Jan Brewer declared that Wood ""did not suffer,"" but didn't explain how she could possibly know this. And, finally, there was a very different kind of punishment served up for our entertainment as the trailer for Fifty Shades of Gray was released, attracting nearly 7 million views in just 24 hours. Somewhere, the Marquis de Sade is smiling."	1	POLITICS

"This week Congress lived down to the standards we've come to expect. First, House Republicans voted to sue President Obama for using executive authority to delay implementation of the health care law they've held over 50 votes to repeal.

But on Friday, after worsening an already bad bill by weakening protections for the children at the center of the crisis, they finally passed a symbolic and useless package -- useless since their Republican counterparts in the Senate already torpedoed that chamber's $2.7 billion border crisis bill. Their ""work"" done, they recessed for a five-week vacation -- during which they will no doubt fundraise, using the ""crisis"" they've failed to address as fodder. If only we could issue an executive order to put an end to this nonsense."	1	POLITICS

With a president too often bold in words but timid in action facing a Congress more Republican and obstructionist than ever, little will get done to fix inequality. Even the Tea Partiers who howled in protest over the bailout of the big banks back in 2008 have been taken to the woodshed by the likes of Karl Rove, and are silent as establishment Republicans complete the return of the GOP as Guardians of the One Percent. For now, don't really expect further taxes on the wealthy that could help those at the bottom. (And did you hear much discussion of America's poor people at the State of the Union?) Funny how trickle-down economics, a concept beloved by the GOP and its plutocratic allies, as well as by corporate Democrats, become an abomination when the galoshes are on the other foot and favor the less well off.

"This week began with all sorts of madness. College hoops' March Madness began on Thursday, and if I had a bracket it would no doubt already be busted. Weather madness broke out on Friday, the first day of spring, with a snowstorm on the East Coast. More serious meteorological madness descended as Senator Mitch McConnell launched a national effort to thwart new EPA regulations on coal-fired carbon emissions. This comes as new data showed that the rate of melting on Antarctica's East Ice could lead to a world sea-level rise of at least 11 feet and that -- spring snowstorms aside -- 2014 was the warmest year on record. On Friday, HuffPost's Sam Stein interviewed President Obama, who, when asked about managing stress, said he takes ""the long view.""

"This week the nation entered terra incognita, as Indiana GOP voters handed Donald Trump a big victory, giving us -- with Ted Cruz and John Kasich dropping out -- the most unqualified, unstable, and dangerous nominee in U.S. history. The events immediately provided a test for Republicans, some of whom rose to the occasion and refused to endorse Trump. Then there was Rick Perry, who once called Trump a ""cancer."" Now? He says he'd consider being his running mate: ""I will be open to any way I can help. I'm not going to say no."" What stirring statesmanship. But this is not just a test for the GOP. It's also a test for the media, who, as David Roberts writes, is likely to give a very unusual campaign the usual media treatment: ""Trump's obvious unfitness for office -- today widely acknowledged across both parties and in the mainstream media -- will become a partisan observation."" So, yes, as the media writes about how various Republicans are handling their character test, we need to remember we're facing one ourselves. The most important mistake the media could make now would be to treat this like a normal election, and Donald Trump like a normal candidate."	1	POLITICS

They should view refugees ""as persons... trying to respond as best we can to their situation.""  He cited the Golden Rule, but expanded it for his Congressional audience, urging the politicians to ""seek for others the same possibilities which we seek for ourselves."" At the UN he called for ""an examination of conscience,"" and asked that ""real human beings take precedence over partisan interests."" It was a master class in true leadership, and the awesome power of humility. Let's hope the Pope's spirit lingers long after he leaves."	1	POLITICS
