If you think love is nothing but kiss and hugs, you haven't felt it yet. I mean no offense to you at all, but that's (at least what I believe) to be true. Love is as much an emotional thing as it is physical. When you find your true love, it's like your life is complete: you don't care if your job sucks, you have no  money, and you look like crap. Just knowing that someone loves you can make all the difference. It can be the best or the worst thing in the world, depending on if it lasts.	8	Family & Relationships

During a civil war in 1348, Emperor John Cantacuzenus allowed the Turks to cross the Dardanelles into Greece. The gates to Europe, so long defended by Constantinople, were now opened to a powerful Muslim empire, and waves of Turks crossed over. By the end of the 14th century, they had conquered all of Bulgaria and most of Greece and had surrounded Constantinople. The rapid expansion of the Turks into Christian Europe changed the nature of the Eastern Crusades. No longer aimed at conquering faraway Palestine, they became desperate attempts to defend Europe itself.	3	Education & Reference

"""America got the President they deserve."" -a former president.\n\nWether or not we elected them or they scandled us into electing them, they're there. And if they cheated their way there, then somebody should have been counting right. \nThe majoity of Cuba chose to put Castro into power, just as the Majority of England supports the monarchy, but elects a prime minister. \nIn 2001, we did not elect our president. Congress selected him. More votes were for Al Gore, but George W. Bush arguably won more electoral votes, owever, he did not win enough to win the election. Because of this, Congress had to make a selection, and did so by the previous. We did elect those in congress though.\n\nAs Bill Clinton said on an interview for the Daily Show just after the 2004 elections, ""America got the president they deserve."""	9	Politics & Government

The most embarrassing thing for me was when I was younger and visiting a church in the area.  It was a strange non-denomiational church that had some really odd beliefs.  I used to smoke back in those days and the pastor was telling his congregation that people should not be afraid to do what they want.  If you feel like jumping up and dancing in church then do it.  Church should be about freedom.  \n\nSo I lit a cigarette and started smoking.  He stopped and told me that there was no smoking in church.  I told him I was just following his lead.  He said that was no what he meant.  I apologized for interrupting his freedom speech and left.  \n\nIt was embarrassing to me now but it was funny then.	0	Society & Culture

"A thermocuple might be the one you seek. \n\nThe seebeck effect on thermocouple uses this theory, as there are two different material soldered together to make a single V or U shaped bar, there is a point where those two metals met. When we heat that point, the heat will move the electron, and since one metal has different coefficient than the other, so the electron will move from one metal to the other, thus an electric current will be created.\n\nPeltier effect, uses the vice versa theory, thus if we put electrical current through that thermocouple, then the thermocouple will need to absorb heat from it surroundings, thus, it will lower the ambient temperature.\n\nI haven't got any clue on how effective does this ""refrigerant"" work, but I think It might, might, might, work.."	1	Science & Mathematics

Israel is the Holy Land and Jerusalem is the Holy City. It is so because it is the promised land and the land where Christ was born and the land where the first temple to Almighty God was built. Jerusalem is the city to where Christ will some day soon return. It is the land God has chosen for Himself and promised to the Jews. It is the Holy Land because it's where Christianity started. No, the Bible doesn't say what type of tree was used to make the cross of Christ. There are many fig trees, acacia trees and palm trees there so it would be difficult to even hazard a guess. Since God is holy and since His Son is holy, the land of God is also called the Holy Land. The Bible doesn't specifically call it that, as far as I know, but it does command the Jews to be a holy nation, as well as Christians.	0	Society & Culture

#1 Arkansas Running Game has been unstoppable by everybody this season.\n\n#2 Casey Dick = Experience . If for some reason we can't get the running game going we now have an experienced QB at hand hand who can throw the ball. Not to mention one of the best receivers in the SEC. (Maybe best, but Sydney Rice is really good).\n\n#3 All but one of the remaining games are at home. Tennessee has to come into our stadium, perhaps having to rely on  backup QB. Erik Ainge doesn't even know how much or if he'll play saturday. MSU well, we won't go there(I respect Crooms program but really don't think there is a chance at the upset).  And LSU has to go to the LR where they have only won once since Houston Nutt has been the head coach. LSU is good, but Russel has been throwing too many interceptions.\n\nMost likely lost would be Tennessee who may be able to put up a lot of points with their passing game.\n\nSugar Bowl will be the Buckeyes vs. Louisville.

Although things may be blurry right now, you made the right decison. I mean you had your reasons for breaking up with your ex, and it sounds like you made sure you were doing the right thing BEFORE breaking up. \n\nThe tricky part comes AFTER the break up. Things that were clear before breaking up, all the reasons you had, they just become blurry and you miss him so much that all you can think about is the good things you had and how maybe you really should be together. But that's just a defense mechanism, you just don't wanna go through all the pain that being apart from that person makes you feel. In that moment you should remember that you had your reasons for breaking up. You should also remember that there was no way of fixing the problem and that's why you had to end it.\n\nThis new guy may be rebound guy or not, no-one knows that. Maybe this new guy it's not right for you and that's all that there is to it.

"First and foremost, choose one that specializes in the restaurant industry. While there are many marketing ""rules"" that apply to any business, restaurants are the single most complicated business structure out there, and the average marketing company has no idea what types of marketing are most effective for restaurants. They concentrate mostly on major media advertising. They are great at buying advertising at discounted rates, but on a whole you'll find their marketing programs expensive and marginally effective.\n\nYou may be better off hiring a restaurant consultant to help you build a marketing program you can maintain yourself. The cost up front will likely be higher, but after a month or two, you'll start to see major savings over using a marketing company. You'll also find that the marketing methods have been tested in other restaurants and proven to be effective. A consultant will also make better associations between your business and your marketing, as the consultant understands restaurants on a completely different level than a marketing company.\n\nSteps in developing a restaurant marketing program include:\n- choosing a USP (Unique Selling Point)\n- branding, interior design and logo design to match USP\n- gathering existing customer data\n- developing a customer rewards program\n- four walls marketing\n- community involvement\n- finding additional revenue streams\n- strategic pricing for increased gross profits\n- understanding and implementing effective menu design\n- understanding and implementing effective ad design\n- email marketing\n- direct mail marketing\n- radio\n- television\n- website\n\nFor the most part, these steps are a pretty good indicator of where to put your efforts first. I'm sure there are some things I left out, but for the most part, the most important and most effective marketing ploys cost the least. A marketing company will concentrate primarily on radio, television and direct mail. They will also likely put you with a rookie employee straight out of marketing school or new to the company, who has no clue what it takes to get people in the door of a business.\n\nIf you'd like more help, feel free to contact me at bodell1@cox.net. Most of what I do can be done via the web, save you a boat load of money in the long run, and will be much more effective that any help you'll get from a marketing company.

If you're in the movies and/or media, of course you're going to want to display the most elegant and good-looking martial arts out there.
